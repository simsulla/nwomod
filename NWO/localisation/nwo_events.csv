EVT_15403_DESC;Colonialism around the world is waning and under pressure of United Nations and various international organizations the subject of giving up superiority over our colonial possessions is currently on the public agenda.

EVT_ENDOFHISTORY_NAME;End of History;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_ENDOFHISTORY_DESC;"Since the darkest days of World War II, the world had largely recovered from its war wounds and the Cold War developed from its modest beginning to a hot competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Clashes between communism and capitalism dominated the decade, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. The conflicts included the Korean War in the beginnings of the decade and the beginning of the Space Race with the launch of Sputnik I. Along with increased testing of nuclear weapons, this created a politically conservative climate. The beginning of decolonization in Africa and Asia occurred in 1950s and accelerated in the following decade. The 1960s have become synonymous with the new, radical, and subversive events and trends of the period, which continued to develop in the following decades. Several governments turned to the left in the early 1960s. In the United States, John F. Kennedy, a Keynesian and staunch anti-communist who pushed for centre-left social reforms such as civil rights for African Americans and healthcare for the elderly and the poor, was elected to the Presidency;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_COLONIALCLAIMS_NAME;Colonial claims;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_COLONIALCLAIMS_DESC;Colonial empires, built around each country's concept of Manifest Destiny and will for prestige and power, started to be obsolete in the middle of 20. century, generating more and more costs while becoming less relevant given considerable emancipation of Asian and African elites. Since the end of Second World War European countries largely became accustomed to an idea that the colonialism is coming to an end but for each country the way this end was going to be handled and the how would future relations with former colonies look like was up to discussion.;;;;;;;;;;X

Daoud abolished the monarchy, abrogated the 1964 constitution, and declared Afghanistan a republic with himself as its first President and Prime Minister.

Ideological debate between the Communist parties of Russia and China also concerned the possibility of peaceful coexistence with the capitalist West. Yet, to the Chinese public, Mao Zedong proposed a belligerent attitude towards capitalist countries, an initial rejection of peaceful coexistence, which he perceived as Marxist revisionism from the Soviet Union. Moreover, since 1956, China and the USSR had progressively diverged about Marxist ideology, and, by 1961, when the doctrinal differences proved intractable, the Communist Party of China formally denounced the Soviet variety of Communism as a product of 'Revisionist Traitors', i.e., the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Nikita Krushchev.;;;;;;;;;;X

(In addition there were 44,000 men in British units in India in 1939.) Their mission was internal security and defense against a possible Russian threat through Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battle fronts as soon as possible. The most serious problem was lack of equipment. Indian units served in Burma, where in 1944-45 five Indian divisions were engaged along with one British and three African divisions. Even larger numbers operated in the Middle East. Some 87,000 Indian soldiers died in the war. On the opposing side, an Indian National Army was formed under Japanese control, but had little effect on the war.;;;;;;;;;;X

Fiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence. The government responded by taking steps to liberalize the economy, and by agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid. But, much of that growth was offset by the fact that the external aid promised never materialized. American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on the economy. At the same time, Indo-US relations were straining due to Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam, and because of President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments to coerce Indian support for the war.

Claiming violations of the Linggajati Agreement, the Dutch described the campaign as Politionele acties ('police actions') to restore law and order. At the time the majority of the Dutch troops in Indonesia belonged to the Royal Netherlands Army.

This second police action was aimed at forcing the Republic to cooperate with the Dutch government in the implementation of the federalist policy as stipulated in the Linggadjati Agreement. The purpose was to organize the new Indonesia as a federal state that would remain closely associated with the Netherlands. The Indonesians had breached the armistice signed following Operatie Product.The Renville Agreement, as the armistice was called, stipulated the withdrawal of Indonesian forces from Dutch-occupied territory in exchange for ending the Dutch naval blockade, and this was indeed put into effect.

The Border Campaign was the first major military undertaking carried out by the IRA since the 1940s, when the harsh security measures of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland governments had severely weakened the IRA. IRA Chief of Staff Tony Magan set out to create 'a new Army, untarnished by the dissent and scandals of the previous decade'. By the middle of this decade the IRA had substantially re-armed. This was achieved by means of arms raids launched between 1951 and 1954, on British military bases in Northern Ireland and England. The plan for the Border Campaign  codenamed ""Operation Harvest""  was devised by Seán Cronin. It envisaged the use of guerrilla units called flying columns, initially four units of about 50 men each. They were to operate from within the Republic of Ireland and to attack military and infrastructural targets within Northern Ireland. In addition, another twenty organisers were sent to various locations within Northern Ireland to train new units, gather intelligence and report back to the leadership in Dublin.

Clann na Poblachta (led by former IRA Chief of Staff Seán MacBride) withdrew its support for the government in protest over this policy. In the ensuing Irish general election, 1957, Sinn Féin won four seats and polled 65,640 votes, while Clann na Poblachta's vote dropped sharply.

In July 1957, after the killing of an RUC man, de Valera introduced wholesale internment without trial for IRA suspects. Then in November 1961 his Minister for Justice, Charles Haughey established military courts which handed down long prison sentences to convicted IRA men.

EVT_8007451_DESC;The partition of Ireland (Irish: críochdheighilt na hÉireann) was the division of the island of Ireland into two distinct territories, Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, and the now Republic of Ireland, an independent state. Partition occurred when the British Parliament passed the Government of Ireland Act 1920 creating Northern Ireland and what was then Southern Ireland. From 1801 to 1920 the whole island had formed a constituent country of the United Kingdom. Before then it was the separate Kingdom of Ireland. The Act of 1920 was intended to create two self-governing territories within Ireland that remained within the UK. The Act also contained provisions for co-operation between the two territories and for the eventual reunification of Ireland. However, partition was reinforced in 1922 when what was intended to be Southern Ireland separated from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free State. Since partition began, a key aspiration of Irish nationalists has been to bring about a united Ireland, with the whole island forming one independent state. This goal conflicted with that of unionists in Northern Ireland, whose objective is to remain part of the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;X

(...) Whoever wants to face these consequences in the form of emigration will not encounter any obstacle.' Most Polish Jews who claimed their nationality status at the end of World War II had emigrated from postwar Poland already in its first years of existence. According to the David Engel's estimates, of the fewer than 281,000 Jews present in Poland at different times before July 1946, approximately 25,00030,000 Jews lived in Poland by 1967. As a group, they had become increasingly assimilated and secular and had well-developed and functioning secular institutions. Of the Jews who stayed in Poland, many had political and career reasons for doing so. Their situation changed after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and the 1968 Polish academic revolt, when the Jews were used as scapegoats by the warring party factions and pressured to emigrate en masse once more.

This time, the Arab attack was suspected but the level of confidence was low. Early at October 6, 1973, the war opening date, Kissinger told Israel not to go for a preemptive strike, and Golda have verified it to him. The American standpoint was crucial as other developed nations, being more dependent on OPEC oil, took more seriously the threat of an Arab oil embargo and trade boycott, and had stopped supplying Israel with munitions.

EVT_8011006_DESC;Pakistani movement towards independence was spearheaded by the Pakistan Movement which refers to the historical action to have an independent Muslim state named Pakistan created from the separation of the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent, partitioned within or outside the British Indian Empire. It had its origins in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (present day Uttar Pradesh). Muslims there were a minority, yet their elite had a disproportionate amount of representation in the civil service and a strong degree of overall influence of culture and literature. The idea of Pakistan spread from Northern India through the Muslim diaspora of this region, and spread outwards to the Muslim communities of the rest of India. The movement was led by lawyer Muhammad Ali Jinnah, along with other prominent political figures such as Allama Iqbal, Liaqat Ali Khan, Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, Aga Khan III, Fatima Jinnah, Bahadur Yar Jung, Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, A.K.

Mohammad Reza Shah’s reform program was built especially to strengthen those classes that supported the traditional system. The Shah advertised the White Revolution as a step towards modernization, but there is little doubt that the Shah also had political motives: the White Revolution (a name attributed to the fact it was bloodless) was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the landlords' influence and create a new base of support among the peasants and working class. The bulk of the program was aimed at Iran’s peasantry, a class the Shah hoped to gain as an ally to thwart the threat of the increasingly hostile middle class.

In 1962 he was elected President for a 5-year term as the candidate of the National Conciliation Party. As a president he signed the Alianza para el Progreso with the United States and accepted a good amount of money to build low-cost housing for Salvadoreans such as the Zacamil buildings and other public works. The Times Magazines from March 16, 1962 said 'Colonel Julio Rivera, is loosening the control of ""the 14,"" a group of land and banking families who have ruled the country since Spanish colonial days', and recognized the biggest effort from the 19 Latin American countries that signed the document during U.S. President John F. Kennedy. At the same time, he started a Secret Service called ANSESAL and the head of this agency was Coronel Medrano, a CIA informant. He is known to have started Death Squads in El Salvador using military intelligence and personnel.

EVT_8012706_DESC;In October 1979 a coup d'état brought the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. Owing to pressure from the oligarchy, this junta was soon dissolved because of its inability to control the army in its repression of the people fighting for unionization rights, agrarian reform, better wages, accessible health care and freedom of expression. In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, death squads were killing about 10 people each day, and the FMLN had 6,000 - 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8014240_DESC;Perestroika was a political movement for reformation within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the 1980s, widely associated with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his glasnost (meaning 'openness') policy reform. The literal meaning of perestroika is 'restructuring', referring to the restructuring of the Soviet political and economic system. Perestroika allowed more independent actions from various ministries and introduced some market-like reforms. The goal of the perestroika, however, was not to end the command economy but rather to make socialism work more efficiently to better meet the needs of Soviet consumers. The process of implementing perestroika arguably exacerbated already existing political, social and economic tensions within the Soviet Union and no doubt helped to further nationalism in the constituent republics. Perestroika and resistance to it are often cited as major catalysts leading to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;X

An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe. The Chernobyl disaster remains up to date the worst nuclear power plant accident in history in terms of cost and resulting deaths, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event (the maximum classification) on the International Nuclear Event Scale (the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011).

EVT_8014242_DESC;Gorbachev's economic changes did not do much to restart the country's sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms decentralised things to some extent, although price controls remained, as did the ruble's inconvertibility and most government controls over the means of production. By 1990 the government had virtually lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies continued. Tax revenues declined because republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supply-demand relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralisation caused new production bottlenecks.;;;;;;;;;;X

However the central figure in the immediate post-Stalin period was the former head of the state security apparatus, Lavrentiy Beria. Beria, despite his record as part of Stalin's terror state, initiated a period of relative liberalization, including the release of some political prisoners. The leadership also began allowing some criticism of Stalin, saying that his one-man dictatorship went against the principles laid down by Lenin.

The plan was in operation for four years beginning in April 1948. The goals of the United States were to rebuild a war-devastated region, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, and make Europe prosperous again. The initiative was named after Secretary of State George Marshall.

In the case of Germany there also were 16 billion marks of debts from the 1920s which had defaulted in the 1930s, but which Germany decided to repay to restore its reputation. This money was owed to government and private banks in the U.S., France and Britain. Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the U.S. Under the London Debts Agreement of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50 percent to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.;;;;;;;;;;X

USIA assets included formerly independent Austrian companies (ÖAF), factories once owned by German corporations (AEG) and former SS enterprises (DEST). At its peak in 1951 the conglomerate employed around 60 thousand people, or 10 percent of Austrian industrial labor.

Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946, the Tribunal was given the task of trying 23 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich, though one of the defendants, Martin Bormann, was tried in absentia, while another, Robert Ley, committed suicide within a week of the trial's commencement. Not included were Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and Joseph Goebbels, all of whom had committed suicide several months before the indictment was signed.

Leningrad, one of the cities with a large amount of classical and baroque architecture on the Baltic Sea, was a city with a pre-war population of three million inhabitants. By August 1941, the Germans had reached the city's southern outskirts. Finnish forces had meanwhile recaptured the Karelian Isthmus North-West of the city. As the Gulf of Finland was blocked as well, Leningrad's only contact with the outer world was a vulnerable waterway across Lake Ladoga. Since taking the city seemed too costly to the Germans, in the light of bitter Soviet resistance, they instead began the Siege of Leningrad in order to starve the city to death.

The intensity and sheer scale of the battle of Stalingrad illustrate the ferocity of the German-Soviet War. Heavy German bombardment, killing thousands of civilians, had turned the city into a landscape of ruins. Workers of the city's weapons factories started personally handing over arms and ammunition to the defending soldiers as the Germans closed in, and eventually continued the fight themselves. Ever more Soviet troops were shipped into the city across the Volga River under enemy fire. German superiority in tanks became useless in the rubble of urban warfare. Fierce man-to-man fighting in streets, buildings and staircases continued for months. The Red Army moved its strategic reserve from Moscow to the lower Volga, and transferred all available aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad area. The Germans eventually lost a quarter of their total forces deployed on the Eastern Front, and never fully recovered from the defeat. The total casualties on both sides are estimated at nearly 2 million, within a period of 200 days.;;;;;;;;;;X

A second Axis offensive against the city, launched in December 1941, failed as well, as the Soviet army and navy forces continued to fight fiercely. Eventually the city was taken in June 1942.

The advance of the German Army Group Centre came to a halt in late November 1941, at the outskirts of Moscow itself. The Soviet Government had by then been evacuated, yet Joseph Stalin remained in the city. Struggling between determination and despair, the city's population helped build defensive positions in the streets. The underground metro stations provided shelter during German air raids. General Georgy Zhukov, who assumed command of the city's defence, largely left close combat tactics to the local commanders on the city's approaches, and focused on concentrating fresh troops from Siberia for an eventual counter-attack. The Soviet counter-offensive was launched on 5 and 6 December 1941. In the freezing cold of an unusually harsh winter, Soviet forces, including well-equipped ski battalions, drove the exhausted Germans back out of reach of Moscow and consolidated their positions on 7 January 1942.

Thousands of civilians volunteered to help defend the city. Eventually Kiev was taken on 19 September. Over 600,000 Soviet troops were taken captive when the pocket was cleared. The prolonged resistance effectively disrupted the German plans of blitzkrieg. However, in military terms, the battle was a great victory for the German Army and a disaster for the Soviets.

EVT_8228001_DESC;After Japanese pulled out from Indochina in late 1945, the area was contested between various forces, some of them working towards a unifed independent Vietnamese state, some of them willing to recreate pre-war order. In January 1946, Vietnam had its first National Assembly election (won by the Viet Minh in central and northern Vietnam), which drafted the first constitution, but the French tried to regain power by force. An accord between France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was made 6 March 1946 but difference of viewpoints made it difficult to work together for the benefit of Vietnam. It was clear that the war between Viet Minh forces and France will break soon. Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide, France fashioned a semi-independent State of Vietnam, within the French Union, with Emperor Bao Dai as Head of State.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8228002_DESC;With the fall of the short lived Japanese colony of the Empire of Vietnam, freshly reinstated French Republic wanted to restore its colonial rule in French Indochina as the final step of the Liberation of France. The French representative was present on board of USS Missouri when Japanese surrender was made. However, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt and General Joseph Stilwell privately made it adamantly clear that the French were not to reacquire French Indochina after the war was over. Roosevelt even offered Chiang Kai-shek to place all of Indochina under Chinese rule. Chiang Kai-shek supposedly replied: 'Under no circumstances!'.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8228003_DESC;Acting upon American tacit agreement, 200 000 troops of the Chinese 1st Army arrived in what would become North Vietnam (Indochina above the 16th parallel). They had been sent by Chiang Kai-shek under General Lu Han to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces occupying that area which had been designated to Chiang Kai-Shek. The Chinese forces initially kept the French Colonial soldiers interned with the acquiescence of the Americans. The Chinese used the VNQDD, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in Indochina and put pressure on their opponents. Chiang Kai-shek threatened the French with war in response to manoeuvering by the French and Ho Chi Minh against each other, forcing them to come to a peace agreement, and in February 1946 he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and renounce their extraterritorial privileges. This was done in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region but if Chinese insisted on coercing Indochina into their sphere of influence, they would be very hard to stop.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8228005_DESC;At the beginning of the war, the U.S. was neutral in the conflict because of opposition to imperialism, because the Viet Minh had recently been their allies, and because most of its attention was focused on Europe. Then the U.S. government gradually began supporting the French in their war effort, primarily through Mutual Defense Assistance Act, as a means of stabilizing the French Fourth Republic in which the French Communist Party was a significant political force. A dramatic shift occurred in American policy after the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War. After the MochMarshall meeting of September 23, 1950, in Washington, the United States started to support the French Union effort politically, logistically and financially. Officially, US involvement did not include use of armed force, at least not openly nor on large scale until 1960s.;;;;;;;;;;X

The VNA fought in joint operations with the French Union's French Far East Expeditionary Corps against the communist Viet Minh forces led by Ho Chi Minh. Benefiting with French assistance the VNA quickly became a modern army modelled after the Expeditionary Corps. It included infantry, artillery, transmission, armored cavalry, airborne, airforce, navy and a national military academy. By 1953 troopers as well as officers were all Vietnamese, the latter having been trained in Ecoles des Cadres.;;;;;;;;;;X

In a later interview General Marcel Bigeard argued that 'one of the deepest mistakes done by the French during the war was the propaganda telling you are fighting for Freedom, you are fighting against Communism'. In the latest days of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, 652 non-paratrooper soldiers from all army corps from cavalry to infantry to artillery dropped for the first and last time of their life to support their comrades.

EVT_8228030_DESC;Throughout the war theater, the Viet Minh cut French supply lines and began to seriously wear down the resolve of the French forces. There were continued raids, skirmishes and guerrilla attacks, but through most of the rest of the year each side withdrew to prepare itself for larger operations. The Battle of Na San saw the first use of the French commanders 'hedgehog' tactics consisting in setting up a well defended outpost to get the Viet Minh out of the jungle and force it to fight a conventional battle instead of ambushes. In late November and early December 1952, Giap attacked the French outpost at Na San, which was essentially an 'air-land base', a fortified camp supplied only by air. Giap's forces were beaten back repeatedly with very heavy losses. The French hoped that by repeating the strategy on a much larger scale, they would be able to lure Giap into committing the bulk of his forces in a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to decimate the exposed Viet Minh forces. The experience at Na San convinced the French of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8228198_DESC;When the North and South were divided politically in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies, one communist and one capitalist. In the North, the communist regime's First Five-Year Plan gave priority to heavy industry, but priority subsequently shifted to agriculture and light industry. Continuous air strikes in the North, slowed large-scale construction considerably as laborers were diverted to repairing bomb damage. Interruptions in electric power, the destruction of petroleum storage facilities, and labor shortages led to a slowdown in industrial and agricultural activity. The disruption of transportation routes by U.S. bombing further slowed distribution of raw materials and consumer goods. In 1960s in the North, all 6 industrial cities, 28 out of 30 provincial towns, 96 out of 116 district towns, and 4,000 out of 5,788 communes were either severely damaged or destroyed. All power stations, 1,600 hydraulics works, 6 railway lines, all roads, bridges, and sea and inland ports were seriously damaged or destroyed.

The codename 'Osoaviakhim' was the acronym of a Soviet paramilitary organisation, later renamed DOSAAF. The operation was commanded by NKVD deputy Colonel General Serov, outside the control of the local Soviet Military Administration (which in a few cases, such as Carl Zeiss AG, tried to prevent the removal of specialists and equipment of vital economic significance for the occupation zone). The operation took 92 trains to transport the specialists and their families (perhaps 10,000-15,000 people in all) along with their furniture and belongings. Whilst those removed were offered generous contracts (the specialists were told that they would be paid on the same terms as equivalent Soviet workers, which in post-war Germany was seen as a gain), there was little doubt that failing to sign them was not a realistic option.;;;;;;;;;;X

Three hundred and twenty-three members of General Belgrano's crew died in the incident. Over 700 men were rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather. The losses from General Belgrano totalled nearly half of the Argentine deaths in the Falklands conflict and the loss of the ship hardened the stance of the Argentine government.

Although the original speech could only be heard in a few parts of occupied France, de Gaulle's subsequent ones reached many parts of the territories under the Vichy regime, helping to rally the French resistance movement and earning him much popularity amongst the French people and soldiers. In Algiers in 1943, Eisenhower gave De Gaulle the assurance in person that a French force would liberate Paris and arranged that the army division of French General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque would be transferred from North Africa to England to carry out that liberation.

Some of these possessions traced their origin to the first expansionist steps of the turn of 19. and 20. century. Others were gained in the interwar period when Japan gained Machuria and tried to subjugate the rest of China. Along with surrender it was sure that some of these lands will change hands and United States, Soviet Union, as well as China will broaden their spheres of possession. The main victor however would have the upper hand in negotiations and receive an extra gratification for their participation in war.

Examples of anglophilia in German media was a long article in the Berliner Illustriete Zeitung newspaper in 1936 extolling the British for ""brutally"" resolving the Fashoda crisis of 1898 in their favor or a series of widely promoted biographies and historical novels commemorating various prominent ""Aryan"" figures from British history such as Cromwell, Marlborough, Nelson, Rhodes, Wellington, and Raleigh.;;;;;;;;;;X

While Hitler cited Mussolini as an influence and expressed privately great admiration for him, Mussolini had little regard for Hitler, especially after the Nazis had assassinated his friend and ally, Engelbert Dollfuss the Austrofascist dictator of Austria in 1934. With the assassination of Dollfuss, Mussolini attempted to distance himself from Hitler by rejecting much of the racialism espoused by the German radical. By 1938 however, the enormous influence Hitler now had over Mussolini became clear with the introduction of the Manifesto of Race by Mussolini, adopting similar racial overtones.

He remained emphatically neutral in the Second World War, but nonetheless offered various kinds of support to Italy and Germany. He allowed Spanish soldiers to volunteer to fight in the German Army against the USSR (the Blue Division), but forbade Spaniards to fight in the West against the democracies. Franco's common ground with Hitler was particularly weakened by Hitler's propagation of Nazi mysticism and his attempts to manipulate Christianity, which went against Franco's fervent commitment to defending Christianity and Catholicism. Yet, after the collapse of France in June 1940, Spain did adopt a pro-Axis non-belligerency stance (for example, he offered Spanish naval facilities to German ships) until returning to complete neutrality in 1943 when the tide of the war had turned decisively against Germany and its allies.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8500204_DESC;On October 15, the CIA's National Photographic Intelligence Center reviewed the U-2 photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles. The next morning, Kennedy was shown the U-2 photographs and briefed on the CIA's analysis of the images. The US had no plan in place because US intelligence had been convinced that the Soviets would never install nuclear missiles in Cuba. The EXCOMM quickly discussed several possible courses of action, including:;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8500205_DESC;Americans could choose many ways of answering the ongoing missile crisis and the Soviets took into account possibility of decisive reply, up to and including military actions. However, those well-camouflaged fears did not materialize and the Americans elected only to send a diplomatic protest. This shows that they don't have political means of exerting real pressure on us, still we may withdraw the nukes if only for the sake of world peace.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8500207_DESC;Kennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout October 21, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases, or a naval blockade of Cuba. Robert McNamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the U.S. in control. Kennedy administration did not think that the USSR would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8500208_DESC;At this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. The USSR had shown no indication that they would back down and had made several comments to the contrary. The U.S. had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early stages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union in case it responded militarily, which was assumed.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8500210_DESC;The message from Khrushchev was surprisingly light on demands and Soviets seemed keen on keeping world at peace. They agreed to withdraw the missiles from Cuba only in exchange for money to cover costs of transport and in small part a great embarassment for USSR.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8500212_DESC;At 9:00 am EDT on October 27, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a message from Khrushchev. The message offered a new trade, that the missiles on Cuba would be removed in exchange for the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey. At 10:00 am EDT, the executive committee met again to discuss the situation and came to the conclusion that the change in the message was due to internal debate between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8500213_DESC;The compromise was a particularly sharp embarrassment for Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of U.S. missiles from Italy and Turkey was not made public—it was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev.

EVT_8500214_NAME;Aftermath of Cuban Missile Crisis;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_8500214_DESC;The practical effect of this Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that it effectively strengthened Castro's position in Cuba, guaranteeing that the US would not invade Cuba. It is possible that Khrushchev only placed the missiles in Cuba to get Kennedy to remove the missiles from Italy and Turkey and that the Soviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the Americans.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_8500214_A;That was close;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_8500215_NAME;Aftermath of Cuban Missile Crisis;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_8500215_DESC;Cuba perceived Soviet agreement with Americans, concerning missiles already placed on Cuba, as a partial betrayal by the Soviets, given that decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev. Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as the status of Guantanamo, were not addressed. This caused Cuban-Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come. On the other hand, Cuba continued to be protected from invasion.;;;;;;;;;;X

Soon though, Dubcek declared the party's mission was 'to build an advanced socialist society on sound economic foundations ... a socialism that corresponds to the historical democratic traditions of Czechoslovakia, in accordance with the experience of other communist parties ...' In April, Dubcek launched an 'Action Programme' of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on consumer goods and the possibility of a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that 'Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy.' It would limit the power of the secret police and provide for the federalization of Czechoslovakia into two equal nations. The programme also covered foreign policy, including both the maintenance of good relations with Western countries and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc nations. It spoke of a ten-year transition through which democratic elections would be made possible and a new form of democratic socialism would replace the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;X

The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate by tying its currency to gold and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. Setting up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the international monetary system, these accords established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which today is part of the World Bank Group. The United States, which controlled two thirds of the world's gold, insisted that the Bretton Woods system rest on both gold and the US dollar. This results in a net flow of capital to the USA.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_15610_DESC;Comecon provided economic and technical support to 34 developing countries in 1960, 62 countries in 1970, and over 100 countries in 1985. As of 1987, Comecon had assisted in the construction or preparation of over 4,000 mostly industrial projects in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.  Comecon had sought to encourage the development of industry, energy, transportation, mineral resources, and agriculture of Third World countries. Comecon countries had also provided technical and economic training for personnel in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. When Comecon initially lent support to developing countries, it generally concentrated on developing those products that would support the domestic economies of the Third World, including replacements for imports. In the 1970s and 1980s, assistance from Comecon had been directed toward export-oriented industries. Third World countries had paid for this support with products, produced by the project for which Comecon rendered help. This policy had provided Comecon with a stable source of necessary deliveries, in addition to political influence in these strategically important areas.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_15611_DESC;The Anglo-American Loan Agreement was a post World War II loan made to the United Kingdom by the United States on 15 July 1946.The loan was made primarily to cover liability incurred by Britain in the war to the US, as well as support British overseas expenditure in the immediate post-war years and not to implement the Labour government's welfare reforms. British treasury officials believed they could implement the Labour government's domestic reforms without the loan if Britain withdrew from all major overseas commitments. The loan was made subject to conditions, the most damaging of which was the convertibility of sterling. Though not the intention, the effect of convertibility was to worsen British post-war economic problems. International sterling balances became convertible one year after the loan was ratified, on 15 July 1947. Within a month, nations with sterling balances (e.g. pounds which they had earned from buying British exports, and which they were now permitted to sell to Britain in exchange for dollars) had drawn almost a billion dollars from British dollar reserves, forcing the British government to suspend convertibility and to begin immediate drastic cuts in domestic and overseas expenditure. The rapid loss of dollar reserves also highlighted the weakness of sterling, which was duly devalued in 1949;;;;;;;;;;X

Gelassenheit is perhaps better understood as a reluctance to be forward, to be self-promoting, or to assert oneself. The Old Order Mennonite's willingness to submit to the "Will of Jesus", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Old Order Mennonite anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on community.

The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission's approval of its merger with Sibneft. According to "Moscow Echo" radio poll, Khodorkovsky would gain 38% of votes in presidential elections, Putin - 14%.

Gessen describes the trial as a “travesty” and “a Kafka-esque procedure,” with the government spending months “on an incoherent account of alleged violations that were criminalized after they were committed, or that were in fact legal activities.” In preparing the case, the government called in Yukos employees for questioning.

EVTDESC1010032;Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who-- in the not-too-distant past-- might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable./n/nNow we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish? Either way," this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC140601;Many of the factory workers in $STATENAME$ live a tragic life. Miserable and dejected," these poor souls are unable to fulfill even the most basic life needs. Among their flimsy shanties and squalid alleys a champion has risen among them. He preaches a new system to the hopeless masses in which every willing man and woman has a job and is provided for. A system in which the rich do not prey upon the weak. Factory workers across the state are heeding his words and the capitalists are fearful of the consequences. We could arrange an ""accident"" during his shift but that will cause great unrest among the workers.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC141101;Minorities in $STATENAME$ are starting to gather and protest over the right to own property. Dishonest landowners in the state have repeatedly abused the minorities by collecting rent and then evicting them on false charges. The minorities have little legal recourse as their rights are almost non-existant. Recently, a family of immigrants who were wrongfully evicted from their residence died from exposure during an extremely cold night. Newspapers have picked up the story and are inflaming public opinion against our residency laws. We could let the anti-residency sentiments grow," or we could pay off some newspapers to run an opposing story detailing the ""uncouth and devious"" nature of the minority's culture.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC2;The 1996 Manchester bombing was an attack carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on Saturday 15 June 1996 in Manchester, England. The 3,300-pound (1,500 kg) bomb, placed in a van on Corporation Street in Manchester city centre, targeted the city's infrastructure and economy and caused widespread damage, estimated by insurers at 700 million pounds (1.1 billion as of 2014).

EVTDESC5;The 7 July 2005 London Bombings, often referred to as 7/7, were a series of coordinated suicide attacks in central London, which targeted civilians using the public transport system during the morning rush hour. On the morning of Thursday, 7 July 2005, four British Traditionalist men detonated four bombs—three in quick succession aboard London Underground trains across the city and, later, a fourth on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square. As well as the four bombers, 52 civilians were killed and over 700 more were injured in the attacks, the United Kingdom's worst terrorist incident since the 1988 Lockerbie bombing as well as the country's first ever suicide attack.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC6;The TGV is France's high-speed rail service developed during the 1970s by GEC-Alsthom and SNCF. Originally designed to be powered by gas turbines, the prototypes evolved into electric trains with the 1973 oil crisis. Following the inaugural service between Paris and Lyon in 1981 on the LGV Sud-Est, the network, centred on Paris, has expanded to connect many cities across France and in adjacent countries on combinations of high-speed and conventional lines. According to Railway Gazette in 2007, a TGV was the fastest scheduled rail journey with a start-to-stop average speed of 279.4 km/h (173.6 mph) between Champagne-Ardenne TGV and Lorraine TGV.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC7;While undertaking an international "farewell tour," Pavarotti was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in July 2006. The tenor fought back against the implications of this diagnosis, undergoing major abdominal surgery and making plans for the resumption and conclusion of his singing commitments, but he died at his home in Modena on 6 September 2007. Within hours of his death, his manager, Terri Robson, noted in an e-mail statement, "The Maestro fought a long, tough battle against the pancreatic cancer which eventually took his life. In fitting with the approach that characterized his life and work, he remained positive until finally succumbing to the last stages of his illness;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC9;The Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement, was a political agreement in the Northern Ireland peace process. It was signed in Belfast on Good Friday on 10 April 1998 by the British and Irish governments and it was supported by most of the political parties in Northern Ireland. On 23 May 1998 the Agreement got the support of the voters of Northern Ireland in a referendum. Also on the same day, voters in the Republic of Ireland voted separately to change their constitution in line with the Agreement. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) were the only large party in the whole of Ireland that were against the Agreement.;;;;;;;;;;X
