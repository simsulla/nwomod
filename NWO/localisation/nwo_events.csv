Currently, our ally experiences such a war, which we will not take part in.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVT_VPCHANGE_NAME;Strategic keypoint;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_15400_DESC;Colonial riots occurred from time to time because of discrepancies in well-being of colonialists and local population, discrimination because of on nationality and growing nationalism of African and Asian nations. Unrest usually started as peaceful marches and demonstrations but sometimes ended up brutally interrupted by police, leaving demonstrators injured or dead.

EVT_15403_DESC;Colonialism around the world is waning and under pressure of United Nations and various international organizations the subject of giving up superiority over our colonial possessions is currently on the public agenda.

EVT_ENDOFHISTORY_NAME;End of History;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVT_ENDOFHISTORY_DESC;"Since the darkest days of World War II, the world had largely recovered from its war wounds and the Cold War developed from its modest beginning to a hot competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Clashes between communism and capitalism dominated the decade, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. The conflicts included the Korean War in the beginnings of the decade and the beginning of the Space Race with the launch of Sputnik I. Along with increased testing of nuclear weapons, this created a politically conservative climate. The beginning of decolonization in Africa and Asia occurred in 1950s and accelerated in the following decade. The 1960s have become synonymous with the new, radical, and subversive events and trends of the period, which continued to develop in the following decades. Several governments turned to the left in the early 1960s. In the United States, John F. Kennedy, a Keynesian and staunch anti-communist who pushed for centre-left social reforms such as civil rights for African Americans and healthcare for the elderly and the poor, was elected to the Presidency;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_COLONIALCLAIMS_NAME;Colonial claims;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVT_COLONIALCLAIMS_DESC;Colonial empires, built around each country's concept of Manifest Destiny and will for prestige and power, started to be obsolete in the middle of 20. century, generating more and more costs while becoming less relevant given considerable emancipation of Asian and African elites.

The most often-repeated story and the Taliban's own story of how Mullah Omar first mobilized his followers is that in the spring of 1994, neighbors in Singesar told him that the local governor had abducted two teenage girls, shaved their heads, and taken them to a camp where they were raped. 30 Taliban (with only 16 rifles) freed the girls, and hanged the governor from the barrel of a tank.

The postwar period to 1962 was a phase of intense import substitution, especially of consumer goods, with basic industries growing at significant but lower rates. The lower increases in the shares of the intermediate and capital goods industries reflect the lesser priority attributed to them by the import substitution industrialization strategy. In the early 1960s, Brazil already had a fairly diversified industrial structure, but one in which vertical integration was only beginning.

EVT_8002627_DESC;The Quiet Revolution was the 1960s period of intense change in Quebec, characterized by the rapid and effective secularization of society, the creation of a welfare state (état-providence), and realignment of politics into federalist and separatist factions. The provincial government took over the fields of health care and education, which had been in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church. It created ministries of Education and Health, expanded the public service, and made massive investments in the public education system and provincial infrastructure. The government allowed unionization of the civil service. It took measures to increase Québécois control over the province's economy and nationalized electricity production and distribution.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8002628_DESC;The October Crisis was a series of events triggered by two kidnappings of government officials by members of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) during October 1970 in the province of Quebec, mainly in the Montreal metropolitan area. The circumstances ultimately culminated in the only peacetime use of the War Measures Act in Canada's history. This response, was criticized at the time and subsequently by a number of prominent leaders who believed the actions to be excessive and the precedent to suspend civil liberties dangerous. The criticism was reinforced by evidence that police officials had abused their powers and detained, without cause, prominent artists and intellectuals associated with the sovereignty movement.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

On September 2, 1976, Mao suffered a heart attack, far more severe than his previous two and affecting a much larger area of his heart. Mao was alert and fully awake during the crisis and he was said to have kept asking his doctors attending to him if he was in any danger and if he was going to die. On September 7, Mao stopped breathing from a sudden attack of pharyngitis and was barely revived by his doctors. The next day, Mao's wife visited the bedridden husband who appeared to recognise her, but could no longer speak and had to communicate with her and his doctors by writing on a notepad. As the doctors were attending to him, Mao suddenly fell into a coma from multiple organ failure and was put on a respirator and life support machines. He was taken off life support shortly before midnight and was pronounced dead ten minutes past midnight on September 9, 1976 at the age of 82.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

China and the Soviet Union were the two largest Communist states in the world. The doctrinal divergence derived from Chinese and Russian national interests, and from the régimes' respective interpretations of Marxism: Maoism and MarxismLeninism. Ideological debate between the Communist parties of Russia and China also concerned the possibility of peaceful coexistence with the capitalist West. Yet, to the Chinese public, Mao Zedong proposed a belligerent attitude towards capitalist countries, an initial rejection of peaceful coexistence, which he perceived as Marxist revisionism from the Soviet Union. Moreover, since 1956, China and the USSR had progressively diverged about Marxist ideology, and, by 1961, when the doctrinal differences proved intractable, the Communist Party of China formally denounced the Soviet variety of Communism as a product of 'Revisionist Traitors', i.e., the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Nikita Krushchev.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8002852_DESC;From the 1960s onwards, nations friendly to the PRC, led by the People's Republic of Albania under Enver Hoxha, moved an annual resolution in the General Assembly to expel the 'representatives of Chiang Kai-shek' and permit the PRC to represent China at the UN. Every year the United States was able to assemble a majority of votes to block this resolution. But the admission of newly independent developing nations in the 1960s gradually turned the General Assembly from being Western-dominated to being dominated by countries sympathetic to Beijing. Not only the newly founded developing countries, but also most of the Western countries eventually decided to recognise the PRC. During 1950s and 1960s, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, and France shifted their recognition of China, from Taipei to Beijing. In the early 1970s, Canada, Turkey, and more western countries established diplomatic relations with the PRC, and severed diplomatic relations with the ROC.

Many members of the new class of wealthy drug lords began purchasing enormous quantities of land, in order to launder their drug money, and to gain social status amongst the traditional Colombian elite. By the late 1980s, drug traffickers were the largest landholders in Colombia and wielded immense political power. They used much of their land for grazing cattle, or left it completely idle as a show of wealth.

EVT_8006704_DESC;For several weeks in the autumn of 1947 and again in 1948 the Princess acted as Regent when, for health reasons, Queen Wilhelmina was unable to perform her duties. The Independence in Indonesia, which saw more than 150,000 Dutch troops stationed there as decolonization force, was regarded as an economic disaster for the Netherlands. With the certain loss of the prized colony, the Queen announced her intention to abdicate.

EVT_8006715_DESC;On 30 April 1980, Beatrix became the monarch when her mother abdicated. By longstanding convention, Beatrix had to sign every piece of legislation before it becomes law. As Queen, her main tasks were to represent the Kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figurehead at home. She received foreign ambassadors and awarded honours and medals. She performed the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc. Beatrix was rarely quoted directly in the press during her reign since the government information service made it a condition of interviews that she may not be quoted. This policy was introduced shortly after her inauguration, reportedly to protect her from political complications that may arise from 'off-the-cuff' remarks.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

The last stages of the freedom struggle from the 1920s onwards saw Congress adopt Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's policy of nonviolence and civil resistance, Muhammad Ali Jinnah's constitutional struggle for the rights of minorities in India, and several other campaigns. Legendary figures such as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose later came to adopt a militant approach to the movement, while others like Swami Sahajanand Saraswati wanted both political and economic freedom for India's peasants and toiling masses.

(In addition there were 44,000 men in British units in India in 1939.) Their mission was internal security and defense against a possible Russian threat through Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battle fronts as soon as possible. The most serious problem was lack of equipment. Indian units served in Burma, where in 1944-45 five Indian divisions were engaged along with one British and three African divisions. Even larger numbers operated in the Middle East. Some 87,000 Indian soldiers died in the war. On the opposing side, an Indian National Army was formed under Japanese control, but had little effect on the war.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

The government responded by taking steps to liberalize the economy, and by agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid. But, much of that growth was offset by the fact that the external aid promised never materialized. American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on the economy. At the same time, Indo-US relations were straining due to Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam, and because of President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments to coerce Indian support for the war.

Indonesia alleged that the region was riddled with communists, and feared that an independent East Timor would influence separatism in the archipelago. Indonesian military intelligence influenced the break-up of the alliance between two largest parties in East Timor, which led to a coup on 11 August 1975, and a month-long civil war. During this time, the Portuguese government effectively abandoned the territory, and did not resume the decolonisation process. On 28 November, leftists unilaterally declared independence, and proclaimed the 'Democratic Republic of East Timor'. Nine days later, on 7 December, Indonesia invaded East Timor, eventually annexing the tiny country of (then) 680,000 people.

The Border Campaign was the first major military undertaking carried out by the IRA since the 1940s, when the harsh security measures of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland governments had severely weakened the IRA. IRA Chief of Staff Tony Magan set out to create 'a new Army, untarnished by the dissent and scandals of the previous decade'. By the middle of this decade the IRA had substantially re-armed. This was achieved by means of arms raids launched between 1951 and 1954, on British military bases in Northern Ireland and England. The plan for the Border Campaign  codenamed ""Operation Harvest""  was devised by Seán Cronin. It envisaged the use of guerrilla units called flying columns, initially four units of about 50 men each. They were to operate from within the Republic of Ireland and to attack military and infrastructural targets within Northern Ireland. In addition, another twenty organisers were sent to various locations within Northern Ireland to train new units, gather intelligence and report back to the leadership in Dublin.

EVT_8007433_DESC;During years of Border Campaign, the Republic’s government, feared that the IRA’s action would drag it into a diplomatic confrontation with Britain and in January 1957, it used the Offences Against the State Act to arrest most of the IRA’s leadership, including its Chief of Staff, Seán Cronin. Clann na Poblachta (led by former IRA Chief of Staff Seán MacBride) withdrew its support for the government in protest over this policy. In the ensuing Irish general election, 1957, Sinn Féin won four seats and polled 65,640 votes, while Clann na Poblachta's vote dropped sharply. Historically, the new government proved even more hostile to the IRA than its predecessor. In July 1957, after the killing of an RUC man, de Valera introduced wholesale internment without trial for IRA suspects. Then in November 1961 his Minister for Justice, Charles Haughey established military courts which handed down long prison sentences to convicted IRA men. The use of internment on both sides of the Irish border made it impossible for the IRA, most of whose leadership was imprisoned, to maintain the momentum of their campaign.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

Partition occurred when the British Parliament passed the Government of Ireland Act 1920 creating Northern Ireland and what was then Southern Ireland. From 1801 to 1920 the whole island had formed a constituent country of the United Kingdom. Before then it was the separate Kingdom of Ireland. The Act of 1920 was intended to create two self-governing territories within Ireland that remained within the UK. The Act also contained provisions for co-operation between the two territories and for the eventual reunification of Ireland. However, partition was reinforced in 1922 when what was intended to be Southern Ireland separated from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free State. Since partition began, a key aspiration of Irish nationalists has been to bring about a united Ireland, with the whole island forming one independent state. This goal conflicted with that of unionists in Northern Ireland, whose objective is to remain part of the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8007682_DESC;In a parliamentary speech on April 11 Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz spelled out the government's official position: 'Loyalty to socialist Poland and imperialist Israel is not possible simultaneously. (...) Whoever wants to face these consequences in the form of emigration will not encounter any obstacle.' Most Polish Jews who claimed their nationality status at the end of World War II had emigrated from postwar Poland already in its first years of existence. According to the David Engel's estimates, of the fewer than 281,000 Jews present in Poland at different times before July 1946, approximately 25,00030,000 Jews lived in Poland by 1967. As a group, they had become increasingly assimilated and secular and had well-developed and functioning secular institutions. Of the Jews who stayed in Poland, many had political and career reasons for doing so. Their situation changed after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and the 1968 Polish academic revolt, when the Jews were used as scapegoats by the warring party factions and pressured to emigrate en masse once more. According to Engel, some 25,000 Jews fled Poland during the 196870 period, leaving in the country between 5,000 and 10,000 Jews.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8007683_DESC;President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt died in September 1970 and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat. In 1971, Sadat, in response to an initiative by UN intermediary Gunnar Jarring, declared that if Israel committed itself to 'withdrawal of its armed forces from Sinai and the Gaza Strip', to 'achievement of a just settlement for the refugee problem', to 'the withdrawal of the Israeli armed forces from all the territories occupied since June 5, 1967', Egypt would then 'be ready to enter into a peace agreement with Israel'. Israel denied this proposal. Sadat hoped that by inflicting even a limited defeat on the Israelis, the status quo could be altered. He declared that Egypt was prepared to 'sacrifice a million Egyptian soldiers' to recover its lost territory. From the end of 1972, Egypt began a concentrated effort to build up its forces.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8007684_DESC;The Israeli general strategy was, for the most part, based on the precept that if war was imminent, Israel would launch a pre-emptive strike. It was assumed that Israel's intelligence services would give, in the worst case, about 48 hours notice prior to an Arab attack. This time, the Arab attack was suspected but the level of confidence was low. Early at October 6, 1973, the war opening date, Kissinger told Israel not to go for a preemptive strike, and Golda have verified it to him. The American standpoint was crucial as other developed nations, being more dependent on OPEC oil, took more seriously the threat of an Arab oil embargo and trade boycott, and had stopped supplying Israel with munitions. As a result, Israel was totally dependent on the United States for military resupply, and particularly sensitive to anything that might endanger that relationship.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

He had little interest in negotiation and felt the retaking of the Golan Heights would be a purely military option. After the Six-Day War, Assad had launched a massive military buildup and hoped to make Syria the dominant military power of the Arab states. With the aid of Egypt, Assad felt that his new army could win convincingly against Israel and thus secure Syria's role in the region. Assad only saw negotiations beginning once the Golan Heights had been retaken by force, which would induce Israel to give up the West Bank and Gaza, and make other concessions.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

Rumors that the crash was a purposefully committed act quickly spread throughout Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In response to general strikes, boycotts of Israeli civil administration institutions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, civil disobedience in the face of army orders, and an economic boycott consisting of refusal to work in Israeli settlements on Israeli products, refusal to pay taxes, refusal to drive Palestinian cars with Israeli licences, graffiti, barricading, and widespread throwing of stones and Molotov cocktails at the Israeli military and its infrastructure within Palestinian territories, Israel deployed 80,000 soldiers to put down the uprising, and adopted a policy of 'breaking Palestinians' bones' and using live ammunition against civilians. Israeli Defense Forces killed an estimated 1,087 Palestinians while Palestinians killed 100 Israeli civilians and 60 Israeli security forces personnel and injured more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and 1,700 soldiers.

EVT_8011305_DESC;As leader of the Colorado Party, Stroessner exercised nearly complete control over the nation's political scene. Although opposition parties were nominally permitted after 1962 (the Colorado Party had been the only legal party in the country since 1947), Paraguay remained for all intents and purposes a one-party state. Elections were so heavily rigged in favor of the Colorados that the opposition had no realistic chance of winning, and opposition figures were subjected to varying degrees of harassment.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

However, several draconian security laws remained in effect, meaning that the substance (if not the form) of the state of siege was still in place. As had been the case for over three decades, opposition leaders continued to be arbitrarily arrested and opposition meetings and demonstrations were broken up. Under these circumstances, the February 1988 election was no different from past elections, with Stroessner officially registering 89 percent of the vote - a margin that his rivals contended could only have been obtained through massive fraud.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8011417_DESC;On February 1, 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran in a chartered Air France Boeing 747. The welcoming crowd of several million Iranians was so large he was forced to take a helicopter after the car he was being transported in from the airport was overwhelmed by an enthusiastic welcoming crowd. Khomeini was now not only the undisputed leader of the revolution, he had become what some called a 'semi-divine' figure, greeted as he descended from his airplane with cries of 'Khomeini, O Imam, we salute you, peace be upon you.';;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8011430_NAME;White Revolution;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVT_8011430_DESC;The White Revolution was a far-reaching series of reforms in Iran launched in 1963 by the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Mohammad Reza Shah’s reform program was built especially to strengthen those classes that supported the traditional system. The Shah advertised the White Revolution as a step towards modernization, but there is little doubt that the Shah also had political motives: the White Revolution (a name attributed to the fact it was bloodless) was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the landlords' influence and create a new base of support among the peasants and working class. The bulk of the program was aimed at Iran’s peasantry, a class the Shah hoped to gain as an ally to thwart the threat of the increasingly hostile middle class. Thus the White Revolution in Iran represented a new attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

To make matters worse, the Shah had a tendency to become indecisive during times of crisis as well. It was believed that the 'silent majority' of Iranians were either apolitical and/or approved of the Shah's government and policies. The Shah began a 'carrot and stick' policy towards the protesters. While still banning street demonstrations, he attempted to address the protesters concerns and act in a conciliatory manner towards them. However the moderate clergy's fear of Khomeini's movement, and the haphazard manner the Shah tried to court the moderates, resulted in very little headway.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8011432_DESC;A span of four months, between October 1978 and January 1979, would prove to be the decisive period that would result in the overthrow of the Shah's government. This period was marked by a widespread unified opposition, massive strikes and demonstrations, protests with a momentum that swept through the whole country, the fleeing from Iran of those who had ties to the Shah, the Shah sinking into depression and despair, global media attention, and an increasingly indecisive and possibly unsupportive United States. The reaction of the protesters to Black Friday, a violent government reaction to mass prostest, spread beyond quickly throughout the country, manifesting in the form of strikes. Increasingly Iranians who supported the protests took to the roofs of their homes during curfew hours at night, chanting 'Allah-u-Akbar!'.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

Opponents of Marcos blocked the necessary legislation to implement his ambitious plans though. Because of this, optimism faded early in his second term and economic growth slowed. Amidst the rising wave of lawlessness and the threat of a Communist insurgency, Marcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972 by virtue of Proclamation No. 1081. Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties, closed down Congress and media establishments, and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists, including his staunchest critics senators Benigno Aquino, Jr., Jovito Salonga and Jose Diokno. The declaration of martial law was initially well received, given the social turmoil the Philippines was experiencing.

Cominform was a Soviet-dominated organization of Communist parties founded in September 1947 at a conference of Communist party leaders in Szklarska Porêba, Poland. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin called the conference in response to divergences among eastern European governments on whether or not to attend the Paris Conference on Marshall Aid in July 1947. The initial seat of Cominform was located in Belgrade (then the capital of the Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia). After the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the group in June 1948, the seat was moved to Bucharest, Romania.

EVT_8014242_DESC;Gorbachev's economic changes did not do much to restart the country's sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms decentralised things to some extent, although price controls remained, as did the ruble's inconvertibility and most government controls over the means of production. By 1990 the government had virtually lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies continued. Tax revenues declined because republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supply-demand relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralisation caused new production bottlenecks.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

They also invited the other republics to join. On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR formally ratified the Belavezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty.

Beria, despite his record as part of Stalin's terror state, initiated a period of relative liberalization, including the release of some political prisoners. The leadership also began allowing some criticism of Stalin, saying that his one-man dictatorship went against the principles laid down by Lenin. Historically, the Politburo members disliked and feared Beria for his role under Stalin and with the support of the armed forces, had him arrested three months after Stalin's death.

This growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes, which some attribute to the strength of labor unions in this period—labor union membership peaked historically in the U.S. during the 1950s, in the midst of this massive economic growth. Much of the growth came from the movement of low income farm workers into better paying jobs in the towns and cities—a process largely completed by 1960. Congress created the Council of Economic Advisors, to promote high employment, high profits and low inflation. The Eisenhower administration (19531961) supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish Keynesianism as a bipartisan economic policy for the nation.

EVT_8023113_DESC;Jan Garrigue Masaryk was a Czech diplomat and politician and Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia from 1940 to 1948. When a Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile was established in Britain in 1940, Masaryk was appointed Foreign Minister and remained on the post following the liberation of Czechoslovakia as part of the multi-party, communist-dominated National Front government. In February 1948 the majority of the non-communist cabinet members resigned, hoping to force new elections, but instead a communist government under Gottwald was formed in what became known as the Czech coup. Masaryk remained Foreign Minister, and was the only prominent minister in the new government who wasn't either a Communist or a fellow traveler. However, he was apparently uncertain about his decision and possibly regretted his decision not to oppose the communist coup by broadcasting to the Czech people on national radio, where he was a much loved celebrity.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

The negotations were fruitless and after a long year of talks it became clear that this non-agression deal serves no-one's interests. Significant agreements failed to appear, as both sides used the time to further prepare themselves for the ensuing conflict. Chiang attacked the CPC with the propaganda piece China's Destiny, which questioned the CPC's power after the war, while the CPC strongly opposed Chiang's leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image. Both leaders knew that a deadly battle had begun between themselves;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8202001_DESC;The Marshall Plan (officially the European Recovery Program, ERP) was the large-scale American program to aid Europe where the United States gave monetary support to help rebuild European economies after the end of World War II in order to combat the spread of Soviet communism. The plan was in operation for four years beginning in April 1948. The goals of the United States were to rebuild a war-devastated region, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, and make Europe prosperous again. The initiative was named after Secretary of State George Marshall. The plan had bipartisan support in Washington, where the Republicans controlled Congress and the Democrats controlled the White House.

In addition to European Recovery Program grants, the Export-Import Bank (an agency of the U.S. government) at the same time made long-term loans at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the U.S., all of which were repaid. In the case of Germany there also were 16 billion marks of debts from the 1920s which had defaulted in the 1930s, but which Germany decided to repay to restore its reputation. This money was owed to government and private banks in the U.S., France and Britain. Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the U.S. Under the London Debts Agreement of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50 percent to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

The government of Austria possessed its own independent vision of the future, reacting to adverse circumstances and at times turning them to their own benefit.

USIA assets included formerly independent Austrian companies (ÖAF), factories once owned by German corporations (AEG) and former SS enterprises (DEST). At its peak in 1951 the conglomerate employed around 60 thousand people, or 10 percent of Austrian industrial labor. USIA was exempt from Austrian tariffs, disregarded Austrian taxation, and could easily trade with Eastern Europe despite the Iron Curtain and Western trade embargoes.

The first, and best known of these trials, described as 'the greatest trial in history' by Norman Birkett, one of the British judges who presided over it, was the trial of the major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal. Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946, the Tribunal was given the task of trying 23 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich, though one of the defendants, Martin Bormann, was tried in absentia, while another, Robert Ley, committed suicide within a week of the trial's commencement. Not included were Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and Joseph Goebbels, all of whom had committed suicide several months before the indictment was signed.

By August 1941, the Germans had reached the city's southern outskirts. Finnish forces had meanwhile recaptured the Karelian Isthmus North-West of the city. As the Gulf of Finland was blocked as well, Leningrad's only contact with the outer world was a vulnerable waterway across Lake Ladoga. Since taking the city seemed too costly to the Germans, in the light of bitter Soviet resistance, they instead began the Siege of Leningrad in order to starve the city to death.

The intensity and sheer scale of the battle of Stalingrad illustrate the ferocity of the German-Soviet War. Heavy German bombardment, killing thousands of civilians, had turned the city into a landscape of ruins. Workers of the city's weapons factories started personally handing over arms and ammunition to the defending soldiers as the Germans closed in, and eventually continued the fight themselves. Ever more Soviet troops were shipped into the city across the Volga River under enemy fire. German superiority in tanks became useless in the rubble of urban warfare. Fierce man-to-man fighting in streets, buildings and staircases continued for months. The Red Army moved its strategic reserve from Moscow to the lower Volga, and transferred all available aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad area. The Germans eventually lost a quarter of their total forces deployed on the Eastern Front, and never fully recovered from the defeat.

The Soviet Government had by then been evacuated, yet Joseph Stalin remained in the city. Struggling between determination and despair, the city's population helped build defensive positions in the streets. The underground metro stations provided shelter during German air raids. General Georgy Zhukov, who assumed command of the city's defence, largely left close combat tactics to the local commanders on the city's approaches, and focused on concentrating fresh troops from Siberia for an eventual counter-attack. The Soviet counter-offensive was launched on 5 and 6 December 1941. In the freezing cold of an unusually harsh winter, Soviet forces, including well-equipped ski battalions, drove the exhausted Germans back out of reach of Moscow and consolidated their positions on 7 January 1942.

Thousands of civilians volunteered to help defend the city. Eventually Kiev was taken on 19 September. Over 600,000 Soviet troops were taken captive when the pocket was cleared. The prolonged resistance effectively disrupted the German plans of blitzkrieg. However, in military terms, the battle was a great victory for the German Army and a disaster for the Soviets.

Soviet resistance was strong, and several counter-attacks were conducted. The Soviets even managed to temporarily break the German encirclement and to evacuate troops out of the pocket.

EVT_8228001_DESC;After Japanese pulled out from Indochina in late 1945, the area was contested between various forces, some of them working towards a unifed independent Vietnamese state, some of them willing to recreate pre-war order. In January 1946, Vietnam had its first National Assembly election (won by the Viet Minh in central and northern Vietnam), which drafted the first constitution, but the French tried to regain power by force. An accord between France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was made 6 March 1946 but difference of viewpoints made it difficult to work together for the benefit of Vietnam. It was clear that the war between Viet Minh forces and France will break soon. Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide, France fashioned a semi-independent State of Vietnam, within the French Union, with Emperor Bao Dai as Head of State.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

The French representative was present on board of USS Missouri when Japanese surrender was made. However, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt and General Joseph Stilwell privately made it adamantly clear that the French were not to reacquire French Indochina after the war was over. Roosevelt even offered Chiang Kai-shek to place all of Indochina under Chinese rule. Chiang Kai-shek supposedly replied: 'Under no circumstances!'.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8228003_DESC;Acting upon American tacit agreement, 200 000 troops of the Chinese 1st Army arrived in what would become North Vietnam (Indochina above the 16th parallel). They had been sent by Chiang Kai-shek under General Lu Han to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces occupying that area which had been designated to Chiang Kai-Shek. The Chinese forces initially kept the French Colonial soldiers interned with the acquiescence of the Americans. The Chinese used the VNQDD, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in Indochina and put pressure on their opponents. Chiang Kai-shek threatened the French with war in response to manoeuvering by the French and Ho Chi Minh against each other, forcing them to come to a peace agreement, and in February 1946 he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and renounce their extraterritorial privileges. This was done in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region but if Chinese insisted on coercing Indochina into their sphere of influence, they would be very hard to stop.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8228005_DESC;At the beginning of the war, the U.S. was neutral in the conflict because of opposition to imperialism, because the Viet Minh had recently been their allies, and because most of its attention was focused on Europe. Then the U.S. government gradually began supporting the French in their war effort, primarily through Mutual Defense Assistance Act, as a means of stabilizing the French Fourth Republic in which the French Communist Party was a significant political force. A dramatic shift occurred in American policy after the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War. After the MochMarshall meeting of September 23, 1950, in Washington, the United States started to support the French Union effort politically, logistically and financially. Officially, US involvement did not include use of armed force, at least not openly nor on large scale until 1960s.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

Military historian Martin Windrow wrote that Battle of Dien Bien Phu, at the end of the war, was 'the first time that a non-European colonial independence movement had evolved through all the stages from guerrilla bands to a conventionally organized and equipped army able to defeat a modern Western occupier in pitched battle.';;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

Benefiting with French assistance the VNA quickly became a modern army modelled after the Expeditionary Corps.

In a later interview General Marcel Bigeard argued that 'one of the deepest mistakes done by the French during the war was the propaganda telling you are fighting for Freedom, you are fighting against Communism'. In the latest days of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, 652 non-paratrooper soldiers from all army corps from cavalry to infantry to artillery dropped for the first and last time of their life to support their comrades. The Cold War excuse was later used by General Maurice Challe through his famous 'Do you want Mers El Kebir & Algiers to become Soviet bases as soon as tomorrow?', during the Algerian War of 1961, with limited effect though.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8228030_DESC;Throughout the war theater, the Viet Minh cut French supply lines and began to seriously wear down the resolve of the French forces. There were continued raids, skirmishes and guerrilla attacks, but through most of the rest of the year each side withdrew to prepare itself for larger operations. The Battle of Na San saw the first use of the French commanders 'hedgehog' tactics consisting in setting up a well defended outpost to get the Viet Minh out of the jungle and force it to fight a conventional battle instead of ambushes. In late November and early December 1952, Giap attacked the French outpost at Na San, which was essentially an 'air-land base', a fortified camp supplied only by air. Giap's forces were beaten back repeatedly with very heavy losses. The French hoped that by repeating the strategy on a much larger scale, they would be able to lure Giap into committing the bulk of his forces in a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to decimate the exposed Viet Minh forces. The experience at Na San convinced the French of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

In 1961, U.S. advisors in South Vietnam, along with the Diem regime, began the implementation of a plan attempted to isolate rural peasants from contact with and influence by the National Liberation Front (NLF). The Strategic Hamlet Program, along with its predecessor, the Rural Community Development Program, played an important role in the shaping of events in South Vietnam during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Both of these programs attempted to separate rural peasants from Communist insurgents by creating communities that in some ways resembled concentration camps. The program led to a decrease in support for Diem’s regime and an increase in sympathy for Communist efforts. By the end of 1963, 12000 of the 17000 strategic hamlets had been dismantled, liberating 5 million people (out of a total population of 14 million at that time).;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

Despite some elements in the Party opposing the use of force, Le Duan won the seat of First Secretary of the Party. As Ho Chi Minh was aging, Le Duan virtually took the helm of war from him. The first step of his war plan was coordinating a rural uprising in the South and forming the Viet Cong toward the end of 1960. Arms, supplies, and troops came from North Vietnam into South Vietnam via a system of trails, named the Ho Chi Minh trail, that branched into Laos and Cambodia before entering South Vietnam. At first, most foreign aid for North Vietnam came from China, as Le Duan distanced Vietnam from the ""revisionist"" policy of the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev.

Continuous air strikes in the North, slowed large-scale construction considerably as laborers were diverted to repairing bomb damage. Interruptions in electric power, the destruction of petroleum storage facilities, and labor shortages led to a slowdown in industrial and agricultural activity. The disruption of transportation routes by U.S. bombing further slowed distribution of raw materials and consumer goods.

We could send them to hold the line against the Japanese to buy time for our professional army to mobilize. Doing so will greatly weaken warlord powers, but will show we are taking the Japanese threat seriously.

The operation was commanded by NKVD deputy Colonel General Serov, outside the control of the local Soviet Military Administration (which in a few cases, such as Carl Zeiss AG, tried to prevent the removal of specialists and equipment of vital economic significance for the occupation zone). The operation took 92 trains to transport the specialists and their families (perhaps 10,000-15,000 people in all) along with their furniture and belongings. Whilst those removed were offered generous contracts (the specialists were told that they would be paid on the same terms as equivalent Soviet workers, which in post-war Germany was seen as a gain), there was little doubt that failing to sign them was not a realistic option.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

After a long campaign of island hopping, the Allies were approaching Japan, and planned to use Okinawa, a large island only 340 mi (550 km) away from mainland Japan, as a base for air operations on the planned invasion of Japanese mainland (coded Operation Downfall). Four divisions of the U.S. 10th Army (the 7th, 27th, 77th, and 96th) and two Marine Divisions (the 1st and 6th) fought on the island while the 2nd Marine Division remained as an amphibious reserve and was never brought ashore.

With the assassination of Dollfuss, Mussolini attempted to distance himself from Hitler by rejecting much of the racialism espoused by the German radical. By 1938 however, the enormous influence Hitler now had over Mussolini became clear with the introduction of the Manifesto of Race by Mussolini, adopting similar racial overtones.

He allowed Spanish soldiers to volunteer to fight in the German Army against the USSR (the Blue Division), but forbade Spaniards to fight in the West against the democracies. Franco's common ground with Hitler was particularly weakened by Hitler's propagation of Nazi mysticism and his attempts to manipulate Christianity, which went against Franco's fervent commitment to defending Christianity and Catholicism. Yet, after the collapse of France in June 1940, Spain did adopt a pro-Axis non-belligerency stance (for example, he offered Spanish naval facilities to German ships) until returning to complete neutrality in 1943 when the tide of the war had turned decisively against Germany and its allies.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

It played a prominent role in the U.S. labor movement from the 1920s through the 1940s, having a major hand in founding most of the country's first industrial unions (which would later use the McCarran Internal Security Act to expel their Communist members) while also becoming known for opposing racism and fighting for integration in workplaces and communities during the height of the Jim Crow period of U.S. racial segregation. CPUSA, claiming proletarian internationalism (while the U.S. Government called it espionage), sponsored an elaborate intelligence network on behalf of the Soviet Union, involving over 500 members acting as agents.The sections of the CP's International Workers Order meanwhile organized for communism around linguistic and ethnic lines, providing mutual aid and tailored cultural activities to an IWO membership that peaked at 200,000 at its height.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

In the first decades of the 20th century, it drew significant support from many different groups, including trade unionists, progressive social reformers, populist farmers, and immigrant communities. Its presidential candidate, Eugene V. Debs, twice won over 900,000 votes (in 1912 and 1920), while the party also elected two United States Representatives (Victor L. Berger and Meyer London), dozens of state legislators, more than a hundred mayors, and countless lesser officials. The party's staunch opposition to American involvement in World War I, although welcomed by many, also led to prominent defections, official repression and vigilante persecution. The organization was further shattered by a factional war over how it should respond to Russia's Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and the establishment of the Communist International in 1919.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8500922_DESC;In August 1941, the Allied powers Britain and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Iran by a massive air, land, and naval assault, subsequently forcing Reza Shah to abdicate in favour of his son. The Anglo-Soviet invasion was instigated in response to Reza Shah's declaration of Neutrality in World War II and refusal to allow Iranian territory to be used to train, supply, and act as a transport corridor to ship arms to Russia for its war effort against Germany. Reza Shah further refused the Allies' requests to expel German nationals residing in Iran, and denied the use of the railway to the Allies. However according to the British embassy reports from Tehran in 1940, the total number of German citizens in Iran - from technicians to spies - was no more than a thousand. Because of its importance in the allied victory, Iran was subsequently called 'The Bridge of Victory' by Winston Churchill.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

Subsequently, a royal decree dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing Zahedi was drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. The Central Intelligence Agency had successfully pressured the weak monarch to participate in the coup, while bribing street thugs, clergy, politicians and Iranian army officers to take part in a propaganda campaign against Mosaddegh and his government. At first, the coup appeared to be a failure when on the night of 1516 August, Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri was arrested while attempting to arrest Mosaddegh. The Shah fled the country the next day. On 19 August, a pro-Shah mob, paid by the CIA, marched on Mosaddegh's residence. According to the CIA's declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-Shah riots on the 19th. Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks, and took over the streets of the city. 800 people were killed during and as a direct result of the conflict. Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life.

Since Romania did not have riot police (Ceau?escu, who genuinely believed that the Romanian people loved him, never saw the need for them), the military were sent in to control the riots because the situation was too large for the Securitate and conventional police to handle. The significance of the army presence in the streets was an ominous one: it meant that they had received their orders from the highest level of the command chain, presumably from Ceausescu himself.

In April, Dubcek launched an 'Action Programme' of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on consumer goods and the possibility of a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that 'Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy.' It would limit the power of the secret police and provide for the federalization of Czechoslovakia into two equal nations.

Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States, hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth. The Western Allies were divided in their vision of the new post-war world. Roosevelt's goals  military victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire, and the creation of a world peace organization  were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean, ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

British treasury officials believed they could implement the Labour government's domestic reforms without the loan if Britain withdrew from all major overseas commitments.

However, the assassination of Habyarimana in April 1994 proved to be the catalyst for the Rwandan Genocide, the commonly quoted death toll for which is 800,000. The closely interrelated causes of the war and genocide led some observers to assume that the reports of mass killings were in fact some new flaring of the war, rather than a different phase.

This scholarly process of "determining orthodoxy began with a question which the Muslim layman, called in that capacity mustaft, presented to a jurisconsult, called mufti, soliciting from him a response, called fatwa, a legal opinion (the religious law of Islam covers civil as well as religious matters). The mufti (professor of legal opinions) took this question, studied it, researched it intensively in the sacred scriptures, in order to find a solution to it. This process of scholarly research was called ijtihid, literally, the exertion of one's efforts to the utmost limit.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

A significant proportion of young men remain in yeshiva until their marriage. After marriage, many Haredi men continue their Torah studies in a kollel. Studying in secular institutions is discouraged, although educational facilities for vocational training in a Haredi framework do exist. In the United States and Europe, the majority of Haredi males are active in the workforce. For various reasons, in Israel, around half of their members do not work, and most of those who do are not officially a part of the workforce.Families are usually large, reflecting adherence to the biblical commandment "Be fruitful and multiply".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_22613_NAME;Old Order Mennonite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_22613_DESC;Having children, raising them, and socialization with neighbors and relatives are the greatest functions of the Amish family. Amish believe large families are a blessing from God. Two key concepts for understanding Old Order Mennonite practices are their rejection of Hochmut (pride, arrogance, haughtiness) and the high value they place on Demut (humility) and Gelassenheit (calmness, composure, placidity), often translated as "submission" or "letting-be". Gelassenheit is perhaps better understood as a reluctance to be forward, to be self-promoting, or to assert oneself. The Old Order Mennonite's willingness to submit to the "Will of Jesus", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Old Order Mennonite anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on community. Modern innovations like electricity might spark a competition for status goods, or photographs might cultivate personal vanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_8000700_DESC;In early July 2003, Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky's partner and the fourth largest shareholder in Yukos, was arrested on suspicion of illegally acquiring a stake in the state-owned fertilizer firm Apatit in 1994. The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission's approval of its merger with Sibneft. According to "Moscow Echo" radio poll, Khodorkovsky would gain 38% of votes in presidential elections, Putin - 14%. He refused to stop financing oppositional parties Yabloko, Union of Right Forces and the Communist Party when Putin demanded it from him. He was the richest person in the country at the moment. On the morning of 25 October 2003, Khodorkovsky was arrested at the Novosibirsk airport. He was taken to Moscow and charged with fraud, tax evasion, and other economic crimes. Gessen describes the trial as a “travesty” and “a Kafka-esque procedure,” with the government spending months “on an incoherent account of alleged violations that were criminalized after they were committed, or that were in fact legal activities.” In preparing the case, the government called in Yukos employees for questioning. Pavel Ivlev, a tax lawyer who went along as their attorney, later explained that officials had illegally interrogated him and threatened to arrest him. After leaving the prosecutor’s office, he immediately flew out of the country. He and his family ended up settling in the U.S.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Non-white South Africans were stripped of South African citizenship and made citizens of the ten ""bantustans"", meant to be tribal homelands for black Africans. Several of these bantustans, including Ciskei and Transkei, were proclaimed by South Africa to be independent, though they were not recognized internationally.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTDESC100001;The electoral victory of a coalition of anti-Apartheid parties has resulted in the reversal of the National Party's discriminatory policies and the acceptance of South Africa's black African majority as a vital part of South Africa's societal fabric.

Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters, are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon.

It's very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state-- one dominated by Irish catholics in Dublin.

EVTDESC1010032;Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who-- in the not-too-distant past-- might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable./n/nNow we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish? Either way," this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC1010033;The revelation that Charles Stewart Parnell has been involved with a married woman, one Catherine O'Shea, and indeed is responsible for her subsequent divorce, was the scandal that ended his political career and prevented him from pushing the Home Rule agenda.

The provisional government's candidate, Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, led the effort to quell an uprising in the city-- leading to resentment among the masses which has translated into Napoleon's landslide. Many fear the man takes too much after his infamous uncle, and thus the idea has arisen of fixing the elections to ensure Cavaignac's victory. This would require us to restrict universal sufferage, as well as muffle the newspapers and political opponents.

Whether the legend was originally a figment of fact or fiction, it was confirmed today, when prospectors in the Witwatersrand struck a motherlode of gold. News of the gold rush are spreading throughout the world like wildfire, and a new town has been incorporated in the province to deal with this new influx of fortune seekers and Uitlanders. The province will henceforth be known, simply, as 'Johannesburg'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC12000;The black smoke pouring out from the pit, in long, drawn out billows, reeks of coal and fire, and the intensity of the smell almost drowns out an undertone of burnt flesh. A hurried commotion breaks out as the survivors of a The Great Explosion of $YEAR$ scurry to save what is left of the coal mine.

EVTDESC1211;By investing more money in crime fighting we have managed to increase government control and decrease crime rates.

EVTDESC12110;The cotton produced in $PROVINCENAME$ is of the highest possible quality and strength. So strong, in fact, is the $PROVINCENAME$ cotton, that the white balls harvested there have begun building quite a reputation for themselves as being some of the best available in the world.

EVTDESC12130;The wool district in $PROVINCENAME$ has become a hub of activity lately, as more and more little cottage weaveries are springing up across the province. While the $PROVINCENAME$ folk have always been known as a thrifty kind, the ready access to some of the world's best wool might also explain this flurry of activity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC1214;The idea behind the rotten boroughs was to create such small voting districts that a certain victory could be won through plain bribery.

EVTDESC12140;The wharfs, quays, and drydocks in $PROVINCENAME$ are abuzz with the rings of hammers and the songs of saws, as the local factory struggles to keep up with new orders for clipper ships that are pouring in from all over the world. Efficient work processes and management, combined with excellent craftsmanship and seamanship, have led $PROVINCENAME$ to produce more and better ships than during any year previous! Perhaps this is the time to rest on the laurels, but, then again, the future is always an uncertainty.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVTDESC1215;By investing more money in crime fighting we have been able to increase the number of control institutions, and thereby made it harder for politicians to use their power and influence for their personal wealth and glory. The militancy among the people in $PROVINCENAME$ should no longer increase so dramatically;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12150;Tragedy struck $PROVINCENAME$ today, when a steam boiler exploded during a routine test in the machine shop contracted to build it for the local steamer factory. Seven workers were killed in the explosion, and several thousands of pounds worth of equipment were destroyed. Local officials are investigating the working conditions in the shop, and hopefully these accidents can be avoided in the future, but, for now, $PROVINCENAME$ mourns her dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC12160;$PROVINCENAME$ has been making quite a name for itself in the cement industry over the past few years. What started out as smalltime production in a family business has now grown to an industry big enough to support the entire province, and the name 'Standard $PROVINCENAME$ Cement' is becoming a household name. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ cement recipes from $PROVINCENAME$ are being admired and imitated across the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC1217;By increasing the amount of government investments into crime fighting we have managed to distribute the wealth in $PROVINCENAME$ more evenly. The gap between rich and poor is no longer as dramatic as it was some time ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12170;Several workers dyed today at the $PROVINCENAME$ dyeworks, when an industrial sized tub of hot dye accidentally spilled out over the workshop floor, and the unsuspecting workers. Locals are upset about the incident, claiming that the poor safety regulations in the hot and dangerous workplace are to blame for the accident, and are urging the government to take action. As rescue workers left the scene, several workshop employees were left dyeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12180;A fuel cistern at the $PROVINCENAME$ refinery exploded today for reasons yet unknown, and the lives of seven workers were claimed in the ensuing conflagration, along with thousands of dollars worth in company property. The refinery owner has washed his hands of any responsibility for the accident, claiming instead that government safety inspections have been lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12190;The $PROVINCENAME$ refinery has been doing well lately, with production exceeding expected quotas by several thousand gallons. Due to storage problems, the refinery owner has approached the government with a deal to buy the fuel at a steep discount. We could either buy the fuel ourselves, or turn him down and wait for him to float the cheap fuel on the market. The local impact of cheap fuel should make the locals fairly happy, but we could probably use the fuel ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12200;Another tragic day for our labourers today, as an accident was reported as having claimed several lives in the $PROVINCENAME$ iron mine. Several workers have been reported injured, and some are still missing. A faulty support beam in the mine collapsed to cause the accident, reports from $PROVINCENAME$ say. The incident is bound to raise at least a local debate on working conditions in our mines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12210;A fisherman off the $PROVINCENAME$ coast has brought in an enormous catch today. His trawler is practically teeming with the riches of the richest of oceans as he anchors in the harbor, and fairly soon other fishermen are able to repeat his example. The fishing is unusually good in $PROVINCENAME$ this year, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12220;The tea harvest is unusually large this year, and nowhere is it larger than in $PROVINCENAME$. Everywhere one ventures in the area, sacks and sacks again stand lined up, brimming with freshly picked leaves of wonderfully smelling tea. This harvest will probably set us straight for years if we're capable of leveraging it right. Should we let the farmers keep an extra portion of the harvest, let our merchants sell it for profit, or should we stockpile it for later use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12230;A local radio station in $PROVINCENAME$ is facing a shortage of radio components for their transmitters, and have been forced to cease brodcasts until the situation is resolved. Local authorities have suggested lending some of the government's radio components to the station, as it fears that the local populace will be alarmed by a lack of news from the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12240;More and more social, religious and educational institutions in $COUNTRY$, primarily from the educated middle classes, are coming to see the influence of alcohol on our society as a moral and social wrong. Pointing at the effects and costs in terms of broken homes, windows and spirits, they urge temperance, with some even going so far as to support calls for outright prohibition. Brewery owners in $PROVINCENAME$ are concerned by the development, and wish to see their future privilege to sell and manufacture alcohol guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12250;A fire at a $PROVINCENAME$ Explosives Warehouse has caused a massive blast that some say could be heard all the way to $CAPITAL$. The devastation is massive, and hundreds of lives in the vicinity are reported lost.

As people's homes are beautified, it only makes sense that the offices of government are, likewise, upgraded to better conform to modern standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12270;Disaster has struck our luxury clothes factory in $PROVINCENAME$, where several shipments have been cancelled over the past few weeks. The reason for the cancellations seems to be that the clothes, quite simply, aren't selling all that well, and no wonder, the cut is wrong, and the buttons look almost clownishly large. Strange, they seemed so nice last season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC12280;Water has seeped into a factory warehouse in $PROVINCENAME$, damaging several shipping crates' worth of clothing. The clothing has been infected by a pungent smelling mold of some kind, and while it doesn't look so bad, the fiber in the cloth reeks of cellar and stale water. We might be able to salvage the clothes, but there is some doubt as to whether anyone would want to use them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC130;Destitution and poverty, along with the other social ills that follow in the wake of a serious drug addiction, are becoming ever more widespread in $PROVINCENAME$ and in the entire $STATENAME$ region. Local anti-drug advocates blame the multitude of crime-syndicates, gangs and officials corruption in $PROVINCENAME$, while other, perhaps less partisan, observers point to unemployment and hard working conditions as determinant factors behind the epidemic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC13010;News reaches us from $PROVINCENAME$ that an expatriate community of foreigners, from various European countries and Great Powers, has formed there.

EVTDESC13015;A group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who left $COUNTRY$ some time ago on an expedition to $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been viciously refused entry to the country. It appears that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has turned gradually to a policy of increasing isolationism, most likely in order to avoid the pains of modernizing their political, economical and social institutions. This policy of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is, obviously, impairing the advances of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ trade, diplomacy and missionary activities in the region, and must be considered an unjust restriction of the international freedom of movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC13040;Despite the obvious rightness of our isolationist policies, some amounts of foreign trade goods could be useful, and elements within our administration have suggested setting up a limited trading post in $PROVINCENAME$, where foreign ships can moor and trade, without compromising the overall intactness of our policy of separateness from the world outside $COUNTRYNAME$. It could be an economic boon to the area and the nation, but conservative voices warn that destructive foreign influences might creep into our society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC13050;A sweet, pungent stench hangs over the backstreets and alleys in $PROVINCENAME$, emanating and spreading in every direction from an epicenter at the foreign trade station. The European traders have brought with them the habit of opium smoking, and our subjects have taken to it on a scale that threatens to become epidemic. It seems that, for every new ship that lands, more and more of our people get caught in the deadly and pacifying web of addiction. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC13051;Due to the trade restrictions on the sale of opium, a number of western merchants have instead gone underground.

Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism? We report, you decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140001;A prominent pacifist preacher in $STATENAME$ has been arguing against the government taking any steps to bolster our nation's military. He has decried any type of military action aside from self-defense. We could silence him permanently, but such a move would spread unrest in the state and infuriate the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14010;The election debates in $STATE$ have been going on for a few days now, and the issue that seems to be becoming the determining one for the outcome of the election is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the economy. Several theories are being advanced, but the voters want a clear statement on government policy. How will the government make sure that every $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen has a chicken in his pot, during the coming term in office?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140101;A decorated and high-ranking officer in $STATENAME$ has started to complain in public regarding his perceived lack of proper arms and supplies allocated to the military. He mingles his complaints with reminiscences of national glory and personal valor on far away battlefields. His voice carries great weight in both the military and general public. If we let him continue the state will undoubtedly become more jingoistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTDESC14020;The morality and virtue of our people has started to decline!' The statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality, on the campaign trail in $STATE$. Many have begun questioning the country's view on religion, and there is no doubt that these issues will play their part in the coming election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140201;A group of young officers in the state of $STATENAME$ have started a barfight over a prostitute in a local tavern and proceeded to kill three lower class workers. A sham trial in a military court has found all the officers innocent and the lower classes are infuriated. If we put them up for re-trial in a civil court the lower classes will be appeased but the image of the military will be hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTDESC14030;Two debaters are arguing heatedly in the qualmy air of the town hall The audience sits dumbfounded as words like 'aliens', 'minorities', and 'ethnic and cultural groups' are thrown between the two. One argues that immigrants are to adopt the dominant culture of their new homeland, while his opponent believes that immigrants should retain their cultural heritage, and that $COUNTRY$ will be strengthened by the influx of a fresh perspective..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140301;The deplorable conditions of a barracks in $STATENAME$ has become the subject of a widely read local newspaper. Maggot infested and rotten food along with faulty arms and ammunition has led to numerous injuries and outbreaks of disease. The barracks is supplied by a highly connected group of aristocrats and capitalists who are pressuring the government to ignore the matter, doing so will greatly upset the local soldiers. If we launch an official investigation the public will surely demand greater spending and oversight for military supply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14040;Opponents and proponents of the military and the armed forces are taking sides for the coming election. While militarists argue that increased tension in the world, and arms races between several of the Great Powers, are reason enough to maintain a strong $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military. Others are less convinced, and see the military expenses as excesses on part of the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140401;A major mine in $STATENAME$ has been running at a deficit for some time now and the owners are on the verge of bankruptcy. The labourers at the mine are unable to find alternative work and fear for their livelihoods. We could step in and subsidize or nationalize the mine but doing so will create greater expectations among the lower classes for intervention in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTDESC14050;Smuggling has become a problem since $STATE$ raised a local Sales & Transfer tariff on several important trade goods, and the issue has become a point of contention in the coming election. Several arguments are being put forth on the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140501;A highly respected university professor has written an increasingly influential theory supporting a laissez-faire economic policy. His theory has gained many supporters from the entrepreneurs of the state who feel threatened by government ties to factory owners. Through our contacts we have learned that this man is a secret homosexual. We could use this against him publically but doing so will anger the entrepreneurs and atheists of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTDESC14060;New foreign, products have begun to out compete several items of $STATE$ produce, and some citizens report increasing difficulties in competing with imported goods on the market. The issue has been raised by local politicians in debates for the upcoming election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140601;Many of the factory workers in $STATENAME$ live a tragic life. Miserable and dejected," these poor souls are unable to fulfill even the most basic life needs. Among their flimsy shanties and squalid alleys a champion has risen among them. He preaches a new system to the hopeless masses in which every willing man and woman has a job and is provided for. A system in which the rich do not prey upon the weak. Factory workers across the state are heeding his words and the capitalists are fearful of the consequences. We could arrange an ""accident"" during his shift but that will cause great unrest among the workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x";;;;
EVTDESC14070;Merchants from $STATE$ are arguing with the minister of finance, who has entertained plans of a nationalization of certain private industries. The heated discussion have reach your ears and you try to cool both sides down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140701;A dark and terrible secret has been brooding among the clergy in $STATENAME$. Whispers in dark corners speak of a deranged priest molesting young children. This pedophile has gone unchecked for quite some time while the rest of the clergy maintained disbelief. Now he is being shuffled about, moved from one parish to another, in order to cover up the story and secure the church's reputation. Rumours of his existence are spreading throughout the populace and the church is begging us to let them handle the matter. They claim that a public hearing would cause their flock to lose faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC14080;The production quota is too high. We will never be able to reach the demand.' The other farmers stand behind him, waiting. Their weathered faces show the same concern and determination as their speaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140801;One of the larger places of worship for our predominant faith in $STATENAME$ has started construction on an expansion. The construction workers have discovered a previously unknown graveyard on the expansion's land that houses the dead of a religious minority. The minority's leaders have insisted that the government halt the expansion. Doing so will appease the minority, but the clergy and moralists will be upset that a chance to put our faith forcefully above all others was missed, especially since the ground has already been consecrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC14090;A debate has flared up in the local $STATE$ election about whether the state should interfere or not in the local economy. Proponents of State capitalism are arguing that a more direct system of government investment and reinvestment could aid in the long term development of local industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC140901;In order to emphasize the multi-religious makeup of $STATENAME$ and the law's relationship with the divine, a courthouse in $STATENAME$ has taken upon itself to install a series of reliefs along its walls detailing great lawbringers from various faiths. The placement of such large and overtly religious carvings has caused a fiery debate to break out between those advocating a seperatation of religion and state and those who applaud the addition of pluralistic religious ideals to the courthouse. With whom shall we side?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14100;Local $STATE$ administration has come under criticism for several instances of government subsidies directed at supporting local industry.  Opponents argue that 'the country's economic planners cannot detect consumer preferences, shortages, and surpluses with sufficient accuracy and therefore cannot efficiently co-ordinate production', and creeping statism has begun to worry the residents of $STATE$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC141001;A teenage girl was found beaten and raped in a cultural minority's section of a city in $STATENAME$. Since the authorities have no leads, members of our primary culture have taken it upon themselves to seek retribution on the minority and anti-minority sentiments are becoming widespread. The local government has turned a blind eye to the whole matter and let the attacks of retribution be carried out. Many people in $STATENAME$ are now calling for severe restrictions to be placed upon the minorities in the nation. Bringing the retribution-seeking attackers to justice probably will not abate the anti-minority sentiments. However, we could falsify an investigation into the rape and claim it was in fact not committed by a minority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC14110;Some of the Faithful in $STATE$ feel that the state has failed in giving them due recognition for their hard work since the last election. For years, they argue, they have assisted the local community in many ways: caring for the sick, taking care of the orphans and helping the needy. They feel that they deserve some form of support so they can continue to help people, and the issue has become a topic of much discussion in the local election campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC141101;Minorities in $STATENAME$ are starting to gather and protest over the right to own property. Dishonest landowners in the state have repeatedly abused the minorities by collecting rent and then evicting them on false charges. The minorities have little legal recourse as their rights are almost non-existant. Recently, a family of immigrants who were wrongfully evicted from their residence died from exposure during an extremely cold night. Newspapers have picked up the story and are inflaming public opinion against our residency laws. We could let the anti-residency sentiments grow," or we could pay off some newspapers to run an opposing story detailing the ""uncouth and devious"" nature of the minority's culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC14120;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ religious policy has become a subject of much debate in the local $STATE$ elections. Many argue that the state needs to maintain a watchful policy of secularization, but this threatens to upset long established religious privileges, and is opposed by many of the local faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC141201;Minorities in $STATENAME$ have gradually lifted themselves out of poverty and into the middle class. They have started their own sports organizations, newspapers, and religious centers. A particularly racist and sharply divided town in $STATENAME$ has voted in a series of laws that effectively bans a large minority's most important cultural festival. The laws probably would not have garnered enough votes if cultural minorities were allowed to vote. The debate about spreading full citizenship to minorities is raging among the state's newspapers and those in favor of full citizenship seem to be gaining the most sympathy. To stop this movement we could stage an arson attack on the racist town's city hall and make it look like the minority was behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC14130;Religion has become an issue in the upcoming electoral debates, as a local religious leader in $STATE$ protests the freedom of religious conversions, arguing that the size of his flock is diminishing, and that this change is fundamentally harmful to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ moral fabric.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC141301;Entrepreneurs in $STATENAME$ fear for their livelihoods. In every stall in every market there seems to be more and more goods stocked from abroad. The entrepreneurs have started a public campaign to sway the rest of the population towards protectionism. Their rallying cry is simple and blunt: 'our nation, our markets, and our goods'. We could launch a public relations campaign detailing the importance of free trade to our export industry but such a move will disgruntle our entrepreneurs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC14140;The renovation of a local church, using public money, has become a hot topic in the local election of $STATE$. Supporters of the project argue that some government support for religion will help preserve not only faith among the people, and thus a local vanguard against the forces of revolution, while opponents argue that the state must not intervene in matters of private religiosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC141401;An association of capitalists in $STATENAME$ have begun a public relations campaign educating their workers on the value of free trade. They have quite successfully persuaded the clerks and workers of the state that free trade is in their and the factories' best interest. The free trade campaign has begun to make an impact on the population as a whole. We could launch a counter campaign emphasizing the necessity of protectionism to many facets of our economy but that would greatly upset the capitalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTDESC14150;The current inflow of immigrants has created a demand for more jobs. Advocates of immigrant rights demand that newly naturalized citizens be accorded the same rights as residents by birth. The situation has become a topic of debate in the local election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC141503;European political parties will be putting forward candidates for the position of President of the European Commission, giving citizens a real say on who runs the EU’s executive arm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC141550;The European free trade agreements eliminate tariffs, import quotas, and preferences on most goods and services traded between the member countries. Should we develop the union and propose it for members?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC14160;Certain residents of $STATE$ feel that the state discriminates against them on account of their origin, and this has become a bone of some contention in the local election, as liberals argue that immigrants and aliens should have their rights respected. Opponents and, indeed, public opinion, seems to be of the mind that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ is not something that one can simply become overnight, and that the process of naturalization takes years, if not generations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC141601;We campaigned as the candidate of the people for the presidency of the Commission. We won a plurality in parliament, and $YEAR$, the Council nominated our candidate for the post. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC14170;Immigration has become a major issue in the local $STATE$ elections, as liberals argue the need to extend the voting franchise to all members of our society, including immigrants. Others, perhaps afraid to see old privileges dislodged, are not as convinced. As the election draws nearer, the debate rages in $STATE$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14180;The debate in $STATE$ in the preludes to the coming election mostly concerns the military and defense policies of $COUNTRY$. The state has long been a bastion of hawkish sentiments with regards to foreign policy, and this year does not seem to be an exception. It is clear that jingoistic policies will be favored in voter turnouts, but a turn in the debate could perhaps reduce the impact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14190;Your generals have begun to complain about the bad food the soldiers are getting and command that more money should be spent on feeding them. The generals argue that the poor diet reduces soldiers' fighting spirit and want to raise it through better food. These issues have become topics of importance to the many military families in $STATE$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14200;A major report that most of the soldiers' weapons are nearly worn out and want someone to go over them to see if they need to be scrapped. To provide soldiers with new weapons would cost more than the current budget for the military can cope with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14210;Pacifist sentiments have been floating about $STATE$ for some time, but in this coming election it seems that whoever can capitalize on the pacifist sentiments in the area will come out a clear winner come election day. The only question still in the air is to which extent pacifist sympathies will hold up through the pre-election debates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;
EVTDESC142501;A major abolutionist running for office in $STATENAME$ has challenged his slave-holding rival to a debate, which has drawn a great deal of attention in the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC142601;A debate being held in $STATENAME$ prompted a riot when arguments being made about slavery prompted anger by abolitionists in the crowd. So far no arrests have been made, but people on both sides of the debate have been calling for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to step in and punish those responsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC14500;A dry spell in one of our colonies has caused friction between colonial officials and locals. The lion's share of the reservoired water in the area has been diverted to colonial factories and plantations, leaving many local smallholders with insufficient water for irrigation. As the days turn into weeks, tensions continue to rise. Diverting more water to local farms is an option, but might be viewed internationally as a sign of weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14510;And it seems to me a travesty that traders long established be allowed these special and, indeed, unfair, prerogatives with regards to the reaping of our common colonial harvest. Paid for, I might add, from the national treasury. Are these benefits to be reaped solely by profiteers and first-comers?'\n\nA debate in parliament concerning the status of traders and trading in our colonies has exploded into a regular fist-fight, as an MP sympathetic to one of our colonial companies lunged at a vocal supporter of free trade, when the latter presented the above accusations to the chamber. This might be a good time to reconsider our colonial trading charters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14520;A colonial charter company has approached us with a request to incorporate a new colonial factory in one of our colonies. While the factory would help local production efficiency, it is also clear that the plans call for the appropriation of several thousand acres worth of land belonging to natives. We will have to weigh the pros of production against the cons of dispossessed, angry natives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14530;... and I argue that this present resurgence of native unrest in the colony is due only to the continued, repeated and wanton mismanagement that our own officials have imposed on the locals. For if the purpose of our presence in our far flung colonies is to uplift and educate, our failure is all the worse when we accomplish the exact opposite.'\n\nNative militancy is rising in one of our colonies, and reports are reaching $CAPITAL$ that the reason for this surge in violence is several incidents of colonial mismanagement. We can seek to redress the problem by finding scapegoats in the Colonial Office, but happy bureaucrats might be more important than happy natives in some god-forsaken colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14540;From the Congo Basin to the deepest fathoms of the Bengal, from the jungles of India to the coasts of Java, scientific taxonomy is making new advances daily. As the light of civilization spreads to even the darkest corners of the earth, the Creator's secrets are, little by little, being unraveled. Turn over any old rock in the colonies, and you will find yet another spectacular piece of miraculous fauna looking back at you, with at least one of its fifteen eyes.'\n\nNew species of exotic fauna are being discovered in the colonies, and a suggestion has been proposed to establish a Colonial Museum of Natural History.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14550;The riches of the colonies flow to our nation's coffers, but it is not only in monetary terms that our nation benefits from its possessions in the New Worlds. The single biggest gain from our colonial presence lies in the continually expanding venues and fields in which our technological advances can be applied, tried and tested.'\n\nCertain well-off philanthropists in $COUNTRY$ have decided to fund a colonial exposition to celebrate our colonies, our missionaries, and our Empire. The question is how we should advertise the exposition. A celebration of our technological prowess, or a grand salute to Empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14560;Here, in these far flung places, forgotten, it seems, by both God and Civilization, barbaric native practices, foreign to the mind of any civilized man, still persist, along with widespread illiteracy, unsanitary living conditions and the sheer ignorance of unenlightened minds.'\n\nThe Colonial Office has published a report on the social conditions in the colonies, and it is not exactly sunny reading. Many of the people in the colonies still live under the conditions of a European Dark Age, or worse, and the Colonial Office strongly suggests that something be done about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14570;Grievous discontent still persists in the colony, despite several attempts by local governors at mediation between local powerholders and the Central Government. The recommendation of the Colonial Office must be that we either take steps to make accommodations with the natives, or that we seek to undermine their authority by enforcing a greater measure of direct rule by the colonial Governor.'\n\nNatives in one of our colonies are dissatisfied with our rule, and we need to make a decision on how to deal with the discontent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14580;Things have gone from bad to worse in $PROVINCENAME$, where the Colonial Police, while in pursuit of two locals suspected of murdering a colonial official, have happened to disturb a shrine of some importance to local religiosity. Natives in the area are infuriated over the perceived lack of respect for their religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14590;A colonial regiment in one of our states threatens to spring into open rebellion, following dissatisfaction over being led by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ commanders. According to military reports, the native recruits have had a hard time adapting to the strict military discipline of a modern army, but a minority report from the Colonial Office speaks of several instances of pugilism and poor behavior from our officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14600;It is unclear if there was, perhaps, something in the air that year. Some theorized that it might have been due to unusual solar activity, others maintained it was nothing but a series of unfortunate coincidences -- a convergence of catastrophes, if you will -- but, whatever had caused it, $YEAR$ saw a wave of unrest spreading through the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonies like wildfire through a dry brushland.'\n\nA wave of unrest shakes our colonies, and we must decide on how to handle it. Concessions to the natives will come at the price of a serious loss of international face, but can we handle not giving them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC14610;Tensions in $PROVINCENAME$, $STATENAME$, have been running high for quite some time, but lately there seems to have been a change in the wind. Things seem calmer in the area, for some reason, and many militants are returning to useful occupations. It might be that we are perceived as too strong to resist, but it might also just be that the anger has burned itself out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14620;The high militancy in $PROVINCENAME$, $STATENAME$, has erupted into a statewide emergency, as violent fighting and looting breaks out on the streets. The situation threatens to turn into a massacre unless something is done soon. Colonial Police are standing by, ready to intervene and attempt to restore order, but are holding back pending detailed instructions from the Governor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14630;And it is therefore the strongest possible recommendation of the Colonial Office that the colony in question be reorganized and reincorporated to prevent the further slide into bureaucratic mismanagement that it has experienced over the past few years, lest wanton spending of public resources, corruption and inefficiencies should all become its bywords.'\n\nOne of our colonies has, due to the lack of an efficient administration, descended into a state of widespread mismanagement. The Colonial Office suggests a reincorporation of the colony to get rid of the problems, but that might be unpopular with the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14640;While anti-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ sentiments have been festering in the colony for some time, it is only very recently that the simmering discontent has erupted into open violence. During the past few months alone, three colonial officials have been killed in the colony, and it is becoming increasingly clear that something must be done about the situation, lest it spin out of control.'\n\nThe calm in one of our colonies has proved deceptive, as native unrest and displeasure with colonial rule has flashed into a state of near open rebellion in a matter of days. The calm before the storm is decidedly over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14650;Lions, Elephants, Giraffes, Buffalo, Panthers and Rhinoceros, the magic and attraction of Africa certainly lies to no small an extent in its many and varied flora and fauna. Big Game hunting has become a major attraction in $PROVINCENAME$, bringing in tourists and tax revenue to all of $STATENAME$. A proposal has surfaced that we invite foreign dignitaries to partake in the $PROVINCENAME$ hunting. While this will certainly boost our international prestige, the locals might not be too happy about tourists trampling around in their plantations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14660;Heia Safari! There is much to see in the $PROVINCENAME$ wilds, and what better way is there to see it than on a safari? Put on your pith helmet and saddle up, because tonight we ride 'til the sun sets, or rises, depending on the heat. $PROVINCENAME$ has become quite a little magnet for wealthy Europeans wanting to experience the beauty and magic of Africa first hand, and modern steamers bring them in like never before. The local fauna has, indeed, been gifted with a new species of wildlife lately: The European Safari-goer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC14700;Me say, load the Banana Boat all night long. Day de light and I wanna go home.'\n- The Banana Boat Song\n\nWith the expansion of our colonial ventures, goods previously unknown to the general public are increasingly being shipped overseas to be enjoyed back home. A banana boat has just docked in one of our harbors, and our citizens marvel at the sweetness and strange looks of this amazing new fruit, previously unknown to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public, as it is being unloaded by the crateload. People are, quite literally, going bananas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14710;So, you see, if $CAPITAL$ could, perhaps, be able to lend us a hand in this little venture of ours, we would be very, very pleased.'\n\nThe government has been approached by several leading members of the country's industrialist elite, who believe that they have found a new possibly profitable racket to dip their fingers in. The proposal concerns one of our colonies, where several acres of viable farmland could potentially be exploited more efficiently under new and industrialized forms of agriculture. Naturally, this proposal would require the expropriation by the state of said land, to then be sold at a fair market price to the interests of capital. Mere technicalities, am I right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14720;And what I can not fathom is why our government insists on paying thousands, if not millions, of pounds, yearly, to maintain imperialistic projects overseas that serve only as strains on the national budget. We were not invited to the colonies, and, frankly, I find our presence in them to be rude.'\n\nAn anti-colonial malaise has taken hold in $COUNTRY$, where more and more of our people are beginning to question our colonial ambitions. The colonies are increasingly being seen more as burdens than as boons, and this situation is beginning to hamper our ability to motivate them before the general public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14730;And when we consider the injustices, wrought by representatives of $COUNTRY$ in the colonies, we will not be surprised to find that '$COUNTRY_ADJ$', in those many places, far beyond our country's shores, has become a byword for theft, larceny and murder.

EVTDESC14750;And while I fully respect my colleague from the loyal opposition, I still cannot help but to question his motives in again and again bringing up the subject of the expenses of the Colonial Office. The colonies are a cornerstone of government policy, and worth paying for.'\n\nThe colonies are making headlines in $COUNTRY$ again, following a fierce debate in the Upper House. Members of the opposition have argued in favor of a reduction of the budget alotted to the Colonial Office, and both they and majority MPs have conducted major offensives in the Upper House, to try and convince swing-voters and aisle-crossers to come out in support of their respective policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14760;A slowly unraveling corruption scandal in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonial Office shakes $CAPITAL$, as a major newspaper publishes reports detailing an extensive network of bribes and favors, designed to give certain private interests preferential treatment with regards to colonial trade and exploitation. Critics of government policy point to the relatively low wages and poor funds alotted to colonial officials as determining reasons for the scandal, while the prevailing mood in government circles seems to be that a culture of corruption within the private sector is to blame for the poor state of the Colonial Office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14770;The growth of our colonies has turned $CAPITAL$ into the constantly expanding cultural and economic nave of an Empire. Every day, with every passing hour, people from every conceivable corner, of the world we have made ours, arrive in our capital: To court our ministers, to trade with merchants, engineers and industrialists, and to experience any one of the multitude of fates that $CAPITAL$ affords its visitors. Standing at $CAPITAL$ Central, one can see all around oneself a small panorama of the world, hear spoken any and all of the varying tongues and languages of the world and smell both the scents and the odors of far away lands. In the annals of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Empire, the years around $YEAR$ will always be remembered as the golden age of $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14780;While the discovery of new lands has always meant the discovery of new diseases and malaises, one of our colonies has recently begun to develop a reputation of being a particularly disease-ridden place. From malaria to colds both common and uncommon, it seems that travelers to and from the colony always catch or bring that little something unsavory extra. According to reports published by a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ doctor established in the colony, a concerted government effort at draining local swamps and marshes, as well as at improving local sanitation, could help the colony, but, of course, such efforts are not free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14790;One of our colonies is reporting astounding successes in the development of local commercial ventures and businesses to the Colonial Office. According to the local governor, the primary reason seems to be an ambitious land reform, undertaken in tandem with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ capitalists and industrialists. The colony is reportedly becoming more attractive to immigrants, and the report reflects well on our industrialists as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14800;An archeological excavation in one of our colonies has yielded fantastic results in the form of several artifacts, tentatively dated to the late paleolithic. The discovery promises to give us new insights in the ancient life and development of the area, and The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ National Archeological society is hailing the discoveries as a great breakthrough for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archeology. The artifacts obviously need to be put in a museum, but where should we put them? The Archeological society strongly argues in favor of The $CAPITAL$ Museum of History, while others have hinted that it might be better to just put them in a local museum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC14810;A situation has presented itself in one of our colonies, where several prominent $CAPITAL$ capitalists have controlling interests in local trade. One of their ventures, a small, local machine shop, run by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ specialists, works on western industrial standards well into the small hours of the morning. The sound from the machine shop is preventing anyone and everyone in the immediate vicinity of the shop from getting much sleep at night, and the issue has become a symbol for many, broader, pent up frustrations with our colonial rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC150;For it is not in the nature of a man of real, unadulterated faith to spend his life idly wasting away under the shackles of an oppressing and unquestioned vice. We must strive for the betterment of ourselves, and of our communities, by expelling from them, once and for all, the pernicious influence of the spirit in the bottle, and raise our eyes, instead, to the spirit in the sky.'\n\nThe Temperance movement has been gaining traction in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ religious circles, and a tent meeting held in one of our states is a prime expression of that sentiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC15600;Our position as controller of one of the pillars of the Bretton Woods system, enables us to act as  the discretionary provision of liquidity to a financial institution or the market as a whole by the our bank in reaction to an adverse shock which causes an abnormal increase in demand for liquidity which cannot be met from an alternative source.This means that the bank is the lender (provider of liquidity) of last resort as there is no other way to increase the supply of liquidity when there is a lack thereof.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC15602;We have lost our position as char and effective controller of the World Bank/International Monetary Fund. This is a disaster, our economy will suffer a stock market crash!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160;Influenced by intensive public opinion and from several vigilante groups, one of our states has adopted a zero tolerance for drugs that facilitates cooperation between social and public institutions to clamp down on drug trade and use in their local districts. With strong public support, the war on drugs has thus prohibited the sale of drugs throughout the state. Many gangs have been dissolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16000;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.' -- Abraham Lincoln\n\nIt is over. All attempts at compromise, the efforts of decades of public discourse on the issue of slavery, have failed. This morning the congressmen from the Southern states resigned their offices, and the slave states declared secession from the perpetual Union. The states of Missouri and Maryland, along with the Western Part of Virginia, have declared themselves for the Union, and Washington D.C. is under the control of Union troops. A southern wind blows hard on our house divided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC160001;A great rebellion has sundered all under Heaven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC1600010;It is as we feared-- the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has assumed control of lands in the south, and any attempts by the local governors to resume authority have failed. It is an embarassment to the prestige of the Imperial throne that we must deign to recognize that these rebels exist and must be dealt with once and for all. Some are even beginning to question the Mandate of Heaven if such a threat is possible. If we do not act, however, the rebels will surely gain control over not only the south but perhaps all of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160001_NEWS_LONG;A great rebellion has sundered all under Heaven! Hong Xiuquan claiming to have received visions naming him a younger brother to Jesus Christ, rebelled from the ruling Manchu-led Qing dynasty and established the Heavenly Kingdom in the south of China, drawing over thirty million of his subjects into one of the most bloody civil wars in history. Taiping rebels want to replace traditional Confucianism, Buddhist and Chinese folk religion with their own form of Christianity, and postulate a number of other progressive reforms like equality of women and common ownership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC160002;We have crushed the 'Heavenly Kingdom', and proven to all of China that the Qing Dynasty yet maintains the Mandate of Heaven. We will abide no more insurrections.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the 'Heavenly Kingdom', the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC160004;Though we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory. We have forced a truce, and now the Manchu will need to deal with rebellions across their land as the people realize their mandate to rule no longer exists. All the world watches us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160006;The continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarassment to the Qing government and our Emperor. Calls have been made for the war to resume, and this time for a national effort be started to draft men into the Qing army. There will be considerable resistance, but the Emperor has decreed that the Heavenly Kingdom must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160007;The truce with the Qing Emperor has come to an end, and already the calls have begun for the Taiping Revolution to continue. The Manchu must be thrown down! All of China must be freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC160008;We have overthrown the hated Manchu and taken control of all China. Now, as the world watches, the true test comes: transforming the nation into the true Heavenly Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160009;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC16001;The one issue that the Founding Fathers of our great nation were never able to answer conclusively, was the question concerning the status of slavery within the union. This inflamed debate has only gained traction in the years since the revolution, and it is presently the singular most important issue on our country's political agenda. Some radical southerners feel that there is no possible compromise to be found on the issue, and that secession is the only alternative to being dominated into emancipation by the central power in Washington. Should our Senate ever be in a position to force political reform on the South, a 40 percent Liberal Upper House, we can be certain that it will not happen without opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160012;We have received reports of Christian missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'. Their actions would not be so objectionable if they were not also preaching sedition against the Manchu-- and, far worse, though provincial governors have attempted to halt the missionaries this has only seemed to stir up support for them even further. There are sightings of their pamphlets all over $STATENAME$ now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160013;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $STATENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160016;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller by the name of Yang Xiuqing has taken to walking the Southlands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160017;Followers of the 'Heavenly Kingdom' are causing further problems in the south. They are already heavily fortified within $PROVINCENAME$, and many Qing advisors consider it completely beyond our control. Anarchy seems rampant, and all throughout $STATENAME$ these rebels are shouting treason. Can nobody do something about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC16002;While debate has been raging in $CAPITAL$ regarding whether to negotiate with the Confederacy, loyal American troops within Confederate territory have been on the move and preparing for the worst. One battalion relocated to Fort Sumter and proceeded to ignore Confederate demands for their immediate withdrawal. Days later, Confederate troops appeared and demanded the fort's surrender-- and when the commander refused, the Confederate forces opened fire. This is a clear provocation. All hopes for a peaceful settlement have now ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160020;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have spread their influence even further. According to officials in $STATENAME$, the Christian rebels have been spotted in $PROVINCENAME$ and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise throughout the entire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC160025;Our beloved leader, the glorious and most holy Hong Xiuquan, has passed away-- ascended into Heaven to receive his just rewards from God. Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power. Others say that Hong Tianguifu is a buffoon and that a proper republic is the way forward. Still others say the unthinkable-- that Hong Xiuquan's death is a sign that the Heavenly Kingdom has lost favor with God, and that the only way to restore it is restore the Qing Dynasty to the Imperial throne-- without, of course, allowing the Manchu to rule the south like errant lapdogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC160026;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Formosa.

EVTDESC16010;John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave, but his soul is marching on.'--John Brown's Body, Union Marching song\n\nThe famed hero of the abolitionist movement, the late John Brown, was hanged in Charles Town, Virginia, today after a failed raid on a military armory. Supposedly, Brown had planned to use the arsenal's weapons to arm slaves and incite an open slave rebellion across the entire south. The raid, and John Brown's death, have furthered escalated southern tension over the slavery issue, and in some slave-states there is now even talk of secession from the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16020;Dred Scott, having been a slave, remains a slave' -- Dred Scott v. Sandford\n\nDred Scott, born a slave in Virginia, has, with the help of abolitionist legal advisers, sued his 'owner', claiming that his present residency in a free state requires his emancipation. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that this is, in fact, not the case, and, effectively, that the property rights of slave-owners are protected regardless of where in the Union the slave resides. The case has caused enormous alarm among northern abolitionists, who see it as the first step to a full extension of the institution of slavery to the whole Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC16040;There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. Here in this pretty world, Gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a Civilization gone with the wind... ' -- Gone With The Wind\n\nThe agrarian economy of the southern United States in many ways resembled the roman villa system, or medieval feudalism, with local economic and political power concentrated to the villas and manors of local landholding 'aristocrats', and in this it differed from the more industrialized North. A different sense of life, while not in itself enough to trigger a civil war, had at some point been one foundations upon which the distinctions between Dixies and Yanks were built.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

The division between the north and the south, often defined by the Mason-Dixon line, was not just over slavery, it was also one of identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC16060;Yankee Doodle went to town,\nA-Riding on a pony\nHe stuck a feather in his cap,\nAnd called it macaroni.'\n\n--Yankee Doodle\n\nThe term Yankee probably derives from a colonial Dutch nickname for English settlers in New England: 'Janke', meaning 'little Jan'.

EVTDESC16090;A secret society dedicated to promoting perceived southern interests in the United States, by the expansion of slavery, The Knights of The Golden Circle have established a chapter in $PROVINCENAME$. We could attempt to suppress the society, but that would be perceived as an assault on our republican traditions by the local populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16100;Founded in 1833, the American Anti-Slavery Society was an organization on the forefront of the American abolitionist movement. With notable members such as Frederick Douglass and Abby Kelley Foster, the society organized meetings, speakings and even published a weekly newspaper between 1840 and 1870, all with the aim of abolishing slavery in the United States. The society has now opened a charter in $PROVINCENAME$. We could attempt to prevent the charter from forming, but that would be perceived as an assault on our republican traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16110;We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.' -- The Declaration of Independence, 1776\n\nThe dank locale is dimly lit, and reeks of sweat and unwashed bodies. Cramped walls, littered with chains and ropes, tell tales of the trade that goes on in this auction house.

EVTDESC16140;The Underground Railroad was an informal network, run by abolitionists of varying creeds and colors, dedicated to helping slaves escape from the southern slave-states to freedom in the North. We have every reason to believe that $PROVINCENAME$ has recently developed into a hotbed of Railroad activity. We could put pressure on local politicians to combat their activities, but only at the risk of stirring up abolitionist sentiments in the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16150;The 'Copperheads' were a group of Democrats in the Northern United States who, during the Civil War, opposed the war, and favored a peace settlement with the South. The moniker came originally from Unionists likening them to poisonous snakes, but it soon struck home with the Copperheads themselves. While there is no war yet, there is staunch resistance to abolitionism within some democratic circles in $PROVINCENAME$. Stepping up the local political campaigning could probably neutralize them, but only at the cost of offending southern sentiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16160;Founded by W.L. Garrison in 1831, The Liberator was one of the most famous abolitionist newspapers in the United States before the Civil War. Although the circulation only ever peaked at a few thousand copies per issue, the paper still received wide notoriety on account of its unwavering advocacy of the abolitionist cause. The Liberator has just published another issue, and the slavery debate has further intensified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16170;Slave Power was a term used to describe the political power of the landed, slave-owning 'aristocrats' of the Southern USA. Many Northern politicians saw slavery first and foremost not as an issue of mistreatment of blacks, but as something profoundly opposed and contrarian to the republican ideals laid out in the founding documents of the United States, and, thus, a threat more to the nation's civic virtues than to anything else. Today the Southern senators blocked a bill in the House of Representatives. While in itself unimportant, the blocking of the bill has revealed the strength of the Southern states in American politics.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVTDESC16180;During the most intense days of the slavery debate, some abolitionists organized emigration to the territories of Kansas and Nebraska in order to prevent these territories from being admitted into the Union as slave-states. The theory of popular sovereignty held that a democratic vote in the state would decide on whether the state should be constituted as slave or free. These abolitionists were called Free Staters, and some of them have now turned up in $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC16300;Harriet Beecher Stove's novel 'Uncle Tom's Cabin', first published in 1852, is one of the most widely read anti-slavery novels ever written. So large was it's perceived impact on the growing national consciousness over the issue of slavery that Abraham Lincoln, upon meeting Stove at the start of the Civil War, is reported as having greeted her: 'So this is the little lady who made this big war.' The publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin has increased national consciousness over the slavery issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16310;In a ruling delivered today, the Supreme Court has decided that the slaves involved in the violent rebellion aboard the Spanish schooner 'Amistad' of 1839, later apprehended near Long Island, New York, were merely, in light of the outlawing of the trans-atlantic slave trade, acting in defense of their personal liberty. The case is viewed as a landmark victory for the abolitionist movement, and public awareness over the slavery issue is rising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC16415;The Ku Klux Klan, abbreviated 'The KKK', was a decentralized organization primarily composed of white southerners, formed in 1865 by Confederate war veterans from Tennessee. A secret vigilante group, known for its iconic symbolism of burning crosses and white hoods and robes, the KKK was formed in opposition to the tenets of Republican Reconstruction, dedicated to preserving white supremacy in the former Confederate states. The Klan shunned few means in accomplishing its goal, and violence directed at southern republicans and blacks was rule rather than exception. The Klan was suppressed by the Federal Government by the passing of the Force Acts of 1871, during the first term of Ulyssess S. Grant. Today we received news that burning crosses have been seen, blazing against the warm, dark night skies of the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC16450;The renowned Apache outlaw Geronimo has surrendered today, to Captain Henry Lawton of The Army, with his small, tattered band of Apache men, women and children. With Geronimo's surrender, the last shred of Apache resistance in the West has died out, and this once proud Indian nation can now be considered pacified. Geronimo will, many years from now, on his deathbed, confess to a nephew that he always regretted the decision to surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC164504;The man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, leaders of the Beiyang army have demanded the Emperor abdicate his throne. Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ greeted the news, but few are aware of the forces now lining up to take control of the government. Kuomintang revolutionaries have demanded a transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a republic with free elections.

EVTDESC164600;Revolutionary societies are springing up all over China, and recently we have received word that several of these societies have banded together as the Tongmenghui or 'Chinese United League'. Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisifed to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide. What's more worrying is that some of the regional warlords appear to be assisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

EVTDESC16501;Delegates from the northern states are growing increasingly impatient with the deadlock in the senate on the issue of slavery, citing what they see as an unreasonable balance of power currently controlled by southern interests.

EVTDESC16510;A convention of northern delegates have convened in Philadelphia to announce the formation of a new union: the Free States of America, free of slavery and dedicated to true freedom for all men. The 'true' American government has decreed this the act of traitors, and is considering whether a peaceful resolution through negotiation is even possible. The so-called Free American government, however, is calling on patriots to rebel against a government held hostage to southern aristocrats and hidebound thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;
EVTDESC16511;While debate has been raging in $CAPITAL$ regarding whether to negotiate with the Free States, loyal American troops within Free State territory have been on the move and preparing for the worst. One battalion relocated to Fort Mifflin and proceeded to ignore Free State demands for their immediate withdrawal. Days later, Free State troops appeared and demanded the fort's surrender-- and when the commander refused, the Free State forces opened fire. This is a clear provocation.

EVTDESC17000;...we will not accept our situation anymore, we will not stand back, we will not remain silent! Give women the right to vote!'\n\nThe development of liberal and feminist thought during the past years have caused women in $COUNTRY$ to form suffragette organizations, demanding that the state accord them legal equality with men. All across $COUNTRY$, women are leaving their primary roles as housewives and caretakers, demanding the right to vote, to work, and to own property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17010;A small group of women have organized an international convention on the subject of women's rights. The two-day $CAPITAL$ Convention has been held, with both men and women attending, but with the first day's proceedings reserved for the ladies, and with the second day devoted almost exclusively to political tactics. Although there was no unanimity between the delegates, the convention has nevertheless decided to adopt ten resolutions which, taken together, demand that women be accorded equality in matters of Family Law, Education, Property Rights, Jobs, Religion, and Morals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17020;The subject of woman's Suffrage has come into national focus at the $CAPITAL$ Anti-Slavery Convention, held just the other day in $CAPITAL$, $COUNTRY$. With several international delegates present, some of whom women, a motion was put before the convention that female delegates, while they should be heard before the chamber, should ultimately be denied the right to vote on any resolutions to be adopted by the convention. The seating arrangements alone have become an issue, as men and women at the convention sit segregated. It is becoming ever more obvious that women in $COUNTRY$, and the entire Western world, are increasingly striving to partake in public discourse and debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17030;With the war dragging on, and more and more of our able-bodied young men being called up for military service, several leading industrialists have suggested that we tap the productive energies of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ womanhood, and rotate women into temporary employment in the factories. This policy, so say the learned of industry, has already been proven successful in several small-scale attempts, where women have been found to be nowhere near the slow learners that common wisdom had otherwise made them out to be. Apparently, they are quite capable of handling the tasks assigned to them in a factory environment. The age of wonders is not past, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17040;And, it is therefore my conclusion, that although there are certain professions generally unsuitable for women to occupy, their presence in the work place poses no fundamental threat to the social order.'\n\nA well-known and respected member of our military establishment has, today, published an opinion editorial in the $CAPITAL$ Courier, one of $COUNTRY$'s leading dailies. In what has been described as the biggest career blunder in the decade, the general has advocated the inclusion of women in the work place, in factories and businesses, arguing primarily that their inclusion and protection under law would only amount to a confirmation of the already established de facto state of women being employed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17050;The $CAPITAL$ weather did its worst against us: mud, mud, mud, was its prominent feature, and it was known among us afterwards as the mud march.'\n\nA female suffragette commented the elements during the Mud March, a demonstration march which, just this past week, attracted over 3,000 women from various organizations, female textile workers, temperance advocates, artists and many other, all coming together in a show of force for Woman's Liberation and Suffrage, on $CAPITAL$'s streets. A gay enough procession by most accounts, despite the weather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17060;Suffragettes, picketing a local bar in one of our provinces, are becoming the laughing stock of the entire state. The sight of the two, relatively frail, upper class women, standing with their placards outside the bar, picketing for Woman's Suffrage and temperance, is not only being made into an object of ridicule, it is also causing some anger among the lower classes, who feel that the well-offs, the high-and-mighties and the holier-than-thous are trying to patronize (or matronize, as the case may be) them with sophistry and rhetoric.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17070;Like many nascent political ideologies, the early suffragette movements were not foreign to in-fighting and organizational splits over issues of tactics and perceived ideological differences, the split between the NUWSS and the NSWRV in Britain being a poignant example. The suffragette movement in $COUNTRY$ is experiencing somewhat of a setback, on account of an organizational split. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17080;A married woman owns no personal property, and her legal identity ceases to exist as husband and wife are joined in one person under law and marriage. We want to change this, we want women to be able to dispose of their own property as they wish. We want the courts of law to recognize a husband and wife as two separate legal entities.'\n\nThe suffragette movement in $COUNTRY$ has organized a rally in one of our states, campaigning for the right of women to receive recognition of the rights, deeds and titles of property that they in many cases already, de facto, hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17090;We covered the entire city. Me and the girls split up, met at the corner of Main St. and 3rd, and then went off to each try to cover a block or two. It was hard work, but I remember it as a happy time.'\n\n$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Suffragettes have undertaken a leaflet campaign in one of our states, in order to gain traction for their cause. All around the city, women can be seen wearing placards and handing out leaflets asking for support for a whole host of suffragette causes: From property, to marriage, to domestic law to the vote and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

A woman has enrolled at one of our institutions of higher learning, and the event has caused a fair amount of scandal among local conservatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17110;Although some women try zealously to incarnate this essence, it is hardly patentable. It is frequently described in vague and dazzling terms that seem to have been borrowed from the vocabulary of the seers, and indeed in the times of St Thomas it was considered an essence as certainly defined as the somniferous virtue of the poppy.'\n- de Beauvoir, Simone -- The Second Sex\n\nA renowned $COUNTRY_ADJ$ suffragette has published a book on what can best be described as the subject of feminist theory, and the book is gaining a fair amount of attention both nationally and internationally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x ;;;;

If the world will not come around to the message that women, considered as political animals, are equal to men in every relevant aspect, then the message will have to come around to it!'\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ suffragette movement has initiated a letter campaign with the ambitious goal of reaching every MP with a thousand letters every year, until female suffrage is passed, and women are given the right to vote. The campaign has had a fair amount of effect already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Local conservatives speak gloomily about the unraveling of the nation's moral fabric, and the end of Western Civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17140;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ suffragette, jailed on account of violent protesting during a rally, has gone on a two week hunger strike in one of our states' prisons, protesting $COUNTRY$'s supposedly poor treatment of its women. The strike is carried out under the slogan 'Votes for women', and the case has made woman's suffrage the focal point of the local political debate, with every newspaper left, right and center reporting on the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17150;The (so-called) Cat and Mouse Act was an infamous British law passed in 1912 in order to combat the suffragette tactic of using hunger strikes as a means to build sympathy for the Suffragette cause. The law stated that a person could be released from jail to recover from any serious illness, only to be jailed again on recovery, thereby washing the government's hands of any harm caused to the woman in question by the hunger strike. A similar ordinance has found its way into the legislature of one of our states, where suffragette hunger strikes are handled in this exact same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17160;A small study circle, dedicated to several issues close to the suffragette agenda for woman's votes, has, during the last few years, begun developing a name for itself in the international debate on Woman's Rights. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ School, as the circle is now being known, has published several tracts on philosophy, politics and economics, all relating to the plight of women all across the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17170;While Woman's Suffrage has been achieved in $COUNTRY$, many other countries still lack the wonders of a modern, egalitarian democracy. From time to time, in a debate, or at an international conference, it might be good to point this out to other countries, or use it as an argument to calm tensions on the homefront.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17500;Hell no, we won't go!'\n\nOne of our states has seen a surge in socialist agitation during the past few months, since the forming of a labour union at one of the local workshops. The workshop seems to have set a local example to other workplaces, and, now, labour appears to be organizing at every mill, workshop and factory in the entire state. The government has been approached by a group of concerned members of the local elite, who call upon the central government to dispatch national guard units to the province in order to ensure that order is maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17510;Screams can be heard from a workplace in one of our states, where socialist agitators have turned an ongoing labour conflict from bad to worse.

EVTDESC17520;A factory in one of our states has become the target of a mild, but costly, sabotage campaign during the past few weeks, and local management suspects that a know socialist agitator in the area is responsible for this development, as the gentleman in question is known by management to have taken issue with a decision they recently took regarding company internal division of labour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17530;A strike today in one of our states, initiated by communist troublemakers and revolutionaries, was swiftly put down by local police. The event has caused a massive backlash against the socialist movement in the state, as local farmers & peasants perceive the red ideology as being vehemently opposed to the traditions and histories of civilization in general, and , $COUNTRY$, more importantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17540;Workers in a machine shop in one of our states have gone out in strike, protesting all manner of ills, real or perceived, in society as a whole and in the workplace. What is infinitely worse than a few redbeards taking a few days off, however, is that many other workers from all across the state have joined them in a state-wide sympathy strike, causing the productive engine of the state to grind to a more or less immediate halt. Harsh methods might have to be employed to resolve this little situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC17550;A new daily with no shame about its political leanings has been incorporated in $CAPITAL$, The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Red Star, official party organ for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist party.

EVTDESC17600;The socialist party in one of our states has recently begun undergoing a distinct metamorphosis, under the influence of its young, charismatic leader. While the party still maintains several core tenants of socialism, such as the emphasis on the state's important societal role, it has also begun embracing religion in with elements of radical nationalism. Black flags have begun waving from the socialist party headquarters in one of our states, and while still prefixed with 'proto-', it is clear that what we are seeing is the formation of a radical new front in the state's politics: Islamism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

From neighboring countries, and from secret, underground breweries and distilleries everywhere, an army of unseen works around the clock to bring the public the finest choices of paint thinners, wood spirits and moonshine. Police have received news that a shipment of illegal alcohol will be entering one of our states tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18000;... and what, with the people desperately clamoring for reform and social justice, hunger riots and class struggle, has our party done to aid the cause of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ workers? Nothing, save the continual reassurance of the eventual fulfillment of vague promises! Colleagues, for these reasons, and many more, I, for one, can no longer consider myself a liberal, except in the true sense of the word: a socialist.'\n\nA block of radical members of the Upper House have defected to form a socialist block, agitating for social reform, equality and worker's solidarity. We could put pressure on the party group to maintain cohesion within its ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18010;Social democracy is democracy in name only. While the party still struggles to maintain illusions, it is long since abundantly evident to any sincere observer that it has come to leave the parliamentary order for a devolution into stale mass-action, rigid dogma and  nepotism. When the levee breaks, let the people know that some stood against the tide.'\n\nA clique of disgruntled within the Upper House have realigned themselves in opposition to socialist refusals to enact political reforms. By exerting political pressure, we can affect the make-up of this new opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18020;... and, yet, it has been said by our self-professed conservatives that the lower classes are unfit -- on account of deficiencies in education, and moral and social understanding -- to have representation. I present to the chamber that this is nothing save base confusion over hen and egg. For if it were ordained by providence that these classes had long since been represented in this noble chamber, then, perhaps, those deficiencies might not still be left unmended to fester.'\n\nA rousing speech in the Upper House today has led to several defections to the liberal faction over the issue of charter reform. The public outcry for universal suffrage continues to grow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18030;... so you see, my dear old friend, that we need your support in the Upper House in order for the motion to carry.'\n\nLiberals in the Upper House have been conducting a charm offensive, directed at 'swing voters' of the other parties, mustering support in the Upper House for a rescinding of the ban on public meetings. The campaign has met with some success, and we need to decide on what to do about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18040;...I've seen the red banners on the streets of $CAPITAL$, and I believe that the only way to combat the rising tide of socialism is through a policy of accommodation.'\n\nA group of reform-minded liberals in the Upper House have decided to cast their lots with the socialist agenda with regards to the issue of trade-union reform. The group, claiming that our present policies allow public opinion too little sway, and arguing that labour reform is needed to protect worker's interests, is organizing to form a parliamentary block. Should we pull some strings in parliament to counter-act this move?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18050;... so it is now, with renewed force, that I restate that conundrum of mine which is yet to garner any sort of response from this chamber: What is to be done about the issue of the press reform? Me, and many colleagues with me, have long argued that the time for reform is now, yet this session has remained entirely unwilling to commit to even an answer, much less a policy.'\n\nReform-minded MPs in parliament have reformed in a new coalition to push the agenda for press reform. Capitalizing on popular sentiment for freedom of expression, the liberals are gaining strength in the Upper House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18060;Which is why we have only a resounding 'No' to offer the propositions of further reforms! We came here with a platform of limited reform, but we now hear talk of reforms that threaten to overthrow every sacred and long established institution of this land, ultimately threatening to unravel the very fabric of our society.'\n\nDisgruntled by the prevailing political winds, an unholy alliance between members of several factions in the Upper House have coalesced into one block dedicated to opposing all further efforts at fundamentally reforming the political system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18070;...anyone opposed?'\n\nDuring a hastily called extraordinary session of the Upper House, a curious motion for constitutional reform has been passed. The reform proposes a system with a party appointed upper house, and the move has all the hallmarks of a putsch by the already ruling reactionary party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18080;A debate on wage slavery has taken hold in the Upper House, and the socialist party is gaining traction by arguing the need for wage reform. The broad popular support for further social reforms has lead to several nominally non-socialist members of the house finding themselves increasingly pressed by their home constituencies to push for further reforms, causing some of them to consider crossing the aisle over to the socialist block. Through political maneuvering, we could probably avoid massive defections to the socialists, but this would probably be seen as an autocratic move by broad stratas of our country's population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18090;The Liberal caucus has convened to further press the agenda for political reform. Citing concerns about alleged infringements of the state apparatus into the private lives of citizens, and a political system firmly lodged in the hands of the few at the expense of the many, the liberals have threatened to block all bills from passing the Upper House until their concerns have been addressed. A few members of other parties are considering aligning themselves with the liberals on the issues of political reform, and any delay on our part will most likely serve to further increase popular frustration over the slow pace of reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18100;...it seems to me, therefore, a defect in our much lauded system that the lowliest workers can not even afford for themselves and their next of kin the bare minimums of sanitary living. The grimy, soot-ridden hovels, huddling under the shadows of the soot-stacks springing up like mushrooms after a rain storm, are damp and dark breeding grounds for flue, tuberculosis and immorality. A limited health reform, dear colleagues, would go far in amending these problems.'\n\nThe Upper House is in turmoil over it's apparent inability to pass social reform, despite mounting public demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18110;I believe it possible that an agreement can be concluded.'\n\nA temporary Upper House Majority has formed on the issue of Unemployment Subsidies. Speaking in parliament, the conservative group leader has opined that he believes that the measures can be enacted, as an experiment with national policy, if nothing else. Citing fears of public discontent with the present plight of the unemployed, his group will back a proposal for modest unemployment benefits. Liberals in parliament remain wholly unconvinced of the proposition, but not enacting the proposal will be seen as a lost opportunity by those pushing for reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18120;I believe therefore that the only natural solution to the present polylemma is to argue in favor of my conservative colleagues on these issues.'\n\nThe strong popular support, combined with rising militancy, for a conservative national policy has led to friction in the Upper House. Several liberal members of parliament are considering defection to the conservative faction, and only ham-handed use of the party whip could possibly keep the liberals in their places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18130;A red wind seems to have taken a tour-de-force through the Upper House lately, as more and more members of parliament express their willingness to cooperate with, and support the ruling socialist party. If we do not wish to see the socialists achieving a single majority in the chamber, now is the time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18140;The Falange is asserting its power both on the streets and in the upper house. Several conservative members of parliament are -- by hook or by crook -- considering defections to the right-wing faction, and preventing these reshufflings will doubtlessly lead to an increase in right-wing militancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18150;The small liberal party is using the social unrest in $COUNTRYNAME$ for political purposes, attempting to turn some of the more left leaning conservatives in the Upper House to their cause. The issue on the table is voting reform, and some conservatives are considering supporting the liberal party over the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18160;And I believe therefore that freedom, shall it not perish from this realm, needs our constant vigilance on its behalf.\n\nA liberal member of the Upper House has held a rousing speech in parliament, criticising the government for what he claims is its failure to amend the rising tide of social unrest in the country. How should the government respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18170;A socialist demagogue in the Upper House has launched a long tirade against the government from the speaker's podium, ridiculing the government for what he calls its inability to quell the increasing social unrest in $COUNTRYNAME$. He claims that, under a socialist regime, the leadership, the party and the masses speak as if with one voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18180;And it seems altogether pleasing, therefore, that the order long established shall prevail, throughout the centuries, throughout the eras, and today.' A conservative member of the Upper House has addressed parliament today with a lionizing speech to the nation and its manifold glories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18190;A reactionary member of the Upper House has addressed the house today, speaking of the need to take back that land which is legitimately and since time immemorial our eternal birth right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18200;...that our traders and merchants have an unrestricted right to the free roam over sea and land, and that no government has the right to interfere therewith.'\n\nA charismatic young member of the Upper House from the anarcho-liberal faction has agitated for a strong policy of free-trade, and people seem to listen to him. We can take this opportunity to push the agenda for laissez faire, or we can anger his supporters by simply ignoring the speech.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18210;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the current enfranchisement offered to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. The discussion so far has been that expanding the voter base has led only to problems, and this bill would tighten the restrictions on voting... to the point where entire groups of people would have their voting rights removed. Passing the bill would no doubt cause problems, but the government seems determined to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18215;A group of the ruling elite in $CAPITAL$ has recently become very concerned at reforms which have made it possible for members of the government to hold views outside of party policies. These reforms have made things too lax, they say, and will ultimately lead to the demise of $COUNTRY$. They've succeeded in gathering enough clout to pass a bill strengthening the power of the party whips, and ensuring that the party's influence in the government remains absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18220;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the press. Many feel that the reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ newspapers to become combative with the government, inciting dissension and making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people harder to control. This control is necessary, they say, if $COUNTRY$ is to remain strong and united. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18225;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the people to gather. Many feel that reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people to become too liberated-- they gather in crowds, protesting the government and otherwise stirring the rest of the rabble. Once upon a time, they say, this simply wouldn't have been allowed. New rules must be put in place to limit the number of people that can meet in one place, and for what purpose. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18230;Members of the ruling party have been busy within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, slowly changing small rules that would make it difficult for opposition parties to get recognized and elected. Political boundaries have been shifted, and in some cases members of the opposition have even been harassed. Now it seems a bill has been put before the government which would entrench a large number of these rules, making them permanent. The government is adamant, saying the rules are needed to keep stability in $COUNTRY$, though the bill will no doubt be incredibly unpopular among the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC185;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Temperance League has been increasingly active in one of our states this year, with a campaign to harass local public houses and liquor merchants. Many of their more politically-minded members have even approached members of the government in $CAPITAL$, pushing for greater support for their campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18500;Today, in cities all across $COUNTRYNAME$, the forces of law and order marched through streets decorated in the colors of their uniforms, showing to all and everyone their continued commitment to maintaining their calm and steadfastness in a hysterical era. The police agencies have also requested a further direction for their work. How do we make the most of this event?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18501;Ours is a nation of equality, where no man is placed above another in importance. Everyone strives for the betterment of all. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a wealthy but criminal industrialist has served not to outrage the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, but rather to reinforce their ideals. Today our people walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18506;Ours is a nation of liberty, where every man is born with the inherent right to seek his own destiny. The possibility of prosperity lies within every man's reach. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the acquittal of a man popularly believed to be innocent has served to reinforce our peoples' ideals. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC18507;It has been often said that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are accustomed to freedom-- they strive for it, hold it as the greatest of ideals. So it is that they chafe under the yoke of what they see as the government's tyranny. A recent demonstration in one of our cities threatens to spread throughout the state. With the eyes of the world upon us, however, forcefully putting an end to this act of civil disobedience will no doubt be seen as an attack upon our own citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18510;Our nation may be broken, but our army is not. In their eyes as they parade through the streets can be seen nothing but utmost devotion to $COUNTRYNAME$, and the ideals for which our nation stands. These men, and the description fits them, have been fostered since childhood into rigid and firm belief in our nation, and they would die to defend it. Long live $COUNTRYNAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18511;Ours is a nation of might, where a man's strength determines his success and everyone knows very well how superior we are to our neighbours. None can hope to compare to $COUNTRY$ on our best day. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the execution of a foreigner believed to have been engaged in criminal activities on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soil has served to reinforce our peoples' beliefs. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC18515;Matters in $COUNTRY$ are getting out of hand. Acts of violence are becoming more commonplace, and some claim that revolution is in the air. Many citizens in $CAPITAL$ are calling on the government to take stronger measures. Sending our army to deal with the violence will, however, only bring the attention of the world upon us. Perhaps this is a time to prove that $COUNTRY$ can deal with its affairs in the way we always have-- with civility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18517;Ours is a nation of order, where peace and civility rule the day. Everyone strives for the common good, and for the progress of our nation as a whole. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a prominent criminal figure who had previously eluded authorities has not outraged the people, but rather has served to reinforce their beliefs. Today the people of $COUNTRY$ walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18520;As the soldiers depart from lodgings and barracks to go off, as young men are want to do, to fight and bleed in the great war, their closed marching columns are saluted on their ways by women and children of all ages, standing along roadsides and on railway stations, sending them off with kisses and smiles, and decorating their weapons with flowers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18521;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: peace, brotherhood and fraternity. Such were the virtues this man believed in, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

EVTDESC18530;In the workshops and mills of our country, the free $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people make daily discoveries and advances. The advancement of science is intimately tied to the free exchange of ideas, and nowhere is the exchange freer than in $COUNTRY$. Our liberty makes us a power house of technological progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18531;A recent dispute with one of our neighbours has had an electrifying effect upon the people of $COUNTRY$: 'How can they be allowed to treat us this way?', they ask. Some are calling for war, while others are satisfied with the knowledge that our nation has already come out on top.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18535;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician.

EVTDESC18540;While some of our policies in the past have been viewed as land-grabbing expansionist imperialism, some people, even abroad, are now arguing that we are simply furthering the cause of human liberty by expanding our nation. A foreign friendship association has recently sent us a telegram of warm congratulations on our latest victories. What is the future course of our nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18550;As militancy rises in $COUNTRY$, demonstrators take to the streets in $CAPITAL$ to protest the government's policies, calling out for political and economical reform. By dispatching additional police forces to control the situation we can prevent further escalations of violence, but then again, it has always been our nation's tradition that people have the right to make their voices heard. By reaffirming our traditional values, we will look strong in the eyes of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18551;Our people have held to our traditions for a very long time. After many years of exposure to the western nations, however, a growing movement has begun to change the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. Intellectuals in $CAPITAL$ say the government should lead the people into an era of progress and not remain mired in our backward ways. Shall we throw these fools into prison, or consider what they have to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18555;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have clashed with members of the aristocracy in $CAPITAL$. The aristocracy has accused the intellectual elite of attempting to cast aside the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life, while the intellectuals say that progress is necessary if $COUNTRY$ is to have any chance against western imperialist powers. The argument of the intellectuals is convincing, but this has not calmed matters in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18556;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have brought several new ideas before the court, ideas that could advance our research considerably. They are also quite contentious, however, and a rejection of the intellectuals could do much to soothe the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18560;A moment ago, they marched and shouted, cries of desperation and anger echoing through the streets. Now, a calm settles over the scene, as the anger subsides into stillness, and strife dissolves into peace. Whatever else can be said about the ails of our country, for all it's flaws and warts and barely overgrown scabs on old wounds, all people in our nation take an equal share in the toils and hardships, and people know this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18561;A great celebration has been held in $CAPITAL$ in honor of $COUNTRY$'s rulers, as well as its centuries of honorable tradition. Massive crowds appeared to cheer on our soldiers, and the spectacle has even drawn the attention of foreigners. Shall we dedicate the celebration to $COUNTRY$'s greatness, or shall we instead use it as an excuse to appease the masses?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18562;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionaries have begun heated debates in one of our states, arguing that $COUNTRY$ should not be slavishly seeking to chase after 'civilized' nations-- indeed, that already $COUNTRY$ has gone too far down the path of degradation and that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people suffer for it. They are calling on the government to repeal reforms, or at the very least to slow down the rapid pace of change... and they are gaining a wide audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18565;$COUNTRY$ is a nation of progress, and our current period of insulation against the western powers runs contrary to that ideal. Shall we call on the borders to be opened once again? It might anger some of our people, but the flow of goods and ideas is invaluable to our prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18570;They sweat and bleed, they toil and strive, always forward, furthering our nation's pride and prestige. The men and women of our nation are of a fine pedigree, and the feeling they all share, of being part of a common communion, and of sharing the same destiny, gives them the sense that the extra effort they put in is always rewarded. Our egalitarian values have caused the people of our nation to put in an extra effort this year. What should we have them do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC18571;We never wanted this contact with the westerners. They bring too many problems into our country, and their influence spreads like an insidious disease. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court are calling for the borders to be closed once again, for us to display to these imperialists that they cannot simply strut about our nation as if they own it. A display of force is necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC18580;End the war! Bread for $CAPITAL$'s workers! A farewell to arms!'\n\nDemonstrations have erupted all across $COUNTRYNAME$, calling for an end to the war effort, and a peace treaty with our enemies.

EVTDESC1859186910;Work on the Suez Canal started in 1859 and was completed in 1869. It connects the Mediterranean with the Red Sea and shortens the journey between Europa and Asia drasticly.

EVTDESC185918695;Today armed bedouins have started a revolt among our workers at the Suez Canal and construction was halted until further notice. We suspect the British are behind this, they opposed our project from the beginning accusing us of using slave labor.

EVTDESC22000;The Trustee System, or 'Trusty System', was a corrections system originated in the U.S. state of Mississippi, but also employed in Alabama, Texas, Louisiana and others, under which prison convicts with a record of good behavior (often equated with obedience) were allowed to police other prison inmates in a strict, pseudo-military hierarchy of power, with some inmates, deemed especially trustworthy, even being allowed to carry firearms. For profit convict labor was a corner stone of the system. The trustee system was first employed on the Parchman Farm prison in Mississippi, and was, as the 19th century turned into the 20th, much lauded as a profitable and modern corrections system.

EVTDESC22010;The idea of isolating offenders and breachers of the public peace from society in general is probably as old as time itself. Many classical systems of justice included banishment from the realm as a last resort type of punishment, reserved for serious crimes and offences, and such punishment was not seldom considered worse than a death penalty. With the growth of the European colonial empires during the 18th and 19th centuries, these ideas received a modern incarnation in the form of the penal colony, with renowned (or infamous) examples being the British colony at Botany Bay and the French 'Devil's Island' in French Guiana. Since $COUNTRY$ occupies several territories that could be well suited for such a purpose, perhaps we ourselves should consider establishing such institutions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC22040;Up and down the roads they march, in single narrow defile, carrying with them, wherever they go, the iron chains of unfree men. These people are not slaves, but convicts, and they have been sentenced by courts and magistrates of justice and peace, to work and spill their sweat under the burning sun. They are a common sight in $COUNTRY$, for there are many men like them. Forced labor is, and has long been, one of the most common forms of punishment available to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ courts. Hard work, it has been said, will improve the moral understanding of these cretins, and, therefore, work they do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC22050;A state-wide manhunt has been called in one of our states, as police report that a convicted murderer has escaped from a local prison facility. While unsettling in itself, the news has also brought our nation's prison system to the public spot-light, fueling a national debate on the issues of crime & punishment. Liberals argue that the escape merely serves as further indictment of the dilapidated and tragic state of our nation's prison system, while conservatives point to the natural constraints on the national budget, and argue that we should not spend the better part of our money on what is arguably the worst part of our citizenry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC22060;And then we have this little fellow. Started out with the proverbial pins and needles and pretty soon he was on to robbing banks. He'll be spending the rest of his life here, so we keep him in chains most of the time. I suspect it will drive him insane in a few years, if it hasn't already.'\n\nImprisonment for life, without the possibility of parole, is not an uncommon punishment in $COUNTRY$, however, in certain liberal circles there have been arguments on the nature of crime and punishment lately, with the opinion being advanced that a human being in chains is incapable of being swayed by the angels of his better nature, while kept under miserable conditions. There is a growing movement for a liberalization of the prison laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC22070;As the 19th century dawned on Europe, the practice of jailing people who defaulted on their debts was still norm. In England, infamous examples of such institutions - Debtor's Prisons - include London's Fleet Prison. In these institutions debtors where not seldom expected to pay for both board and room, and sometimes even special 'Jailor's Fees', to effectively pay their jailors for their upkeep. Often times, these practices only served to further complicate the debtor's financial situation, as it for natural reasons is hard to earn money from inside a prison wall. The system was gradually abandoned in most European countries throughout the 19th century, and London's Fleet Prison was torn down in 1846. A wrongly jailed $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocrat is now drawing public attention to these institutions, calling for their abolishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC22080;A debate in the $CAPITAL$ Reform Club tonight, regarding the death penalty, has seen new arguments advanced from the opponents of the punishment. Focusing in on the irrevocability of the punishment, in tandem with the ever present risk of wrongful sentencing, liberals have joined together to form a Citizen's committee to abolish the sentence. The debate has been caused by the much publicized recent execution of an elderly gentleman convicted of murdering his wife, despite the fact that the man was clearly in the advanced stages of age related dementia. The newly founded committee calls upon members of parliament to speak out against what they consider to be the most horrendous of injustices, and have sought an audience with the cabinet to explain their position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

As people scramble to secure their life savings, more and more banks and credit institutions fail, triggering domino effects affecting the entire $COUNTRY_ADJ$ financial sector. The ripples from the crash soon spread to other sectors of private industry, as loans are defaulted and savings vanish seemingly into thin air. Widespread unemployment, caused by entire sectors of industry failing almost overnight, soon follow. With the intertwining of the economies of the western world, the crisis quickly spreads to other countries, and the effects of the crash now reverberate around the world, in what will be known to posterity as: The $YEAR$ Great Depression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC22520;As there are no laws prohibiting or regulating private banking practices in $COUNTRY$, several private institutions are issuing their own currencies. While some argue that the hard earned savings of the common man are far too important to be left to the private sector, the case is rather the opposite in one of our states, where the plethora of banking institutions available allows people the freedom of choice to save their money in banks, and thus currencies, which they actually know and trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC22530;A newly formed railway company in one of our states has issued shares in the company to help finance the burgeoning firm, and are now seeking buyers and investors in the state. The CEO of the company has approached local politicians, asking them if they could, perhaps, lend a bit of a hand in the marketing of these shares to the general public, arguing that an extension of the railway networks in the state can only be beneficial and should be promoted. Some feel that this might infringe on the principles of official neutrality with regards to private ventures, while other see only opportunities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC22550;A bank run has ensued in one of our states today, following news that a local bank has been issuing currency to a value far exceeding its liquid assets. The situation has been raised to the national level and parliament, where opponents of free banking use the case to argue against the system of free banking as such, calling on the government to move toward a tighter regulation of the banking sector, which is opposed by powerful interests within industrialist circles and the free trade lobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC22560;Our country's economy has been booming of late, following a long period of relatively low unemployment and a well fed populace. High savings and a productive population, combined with advances in the field of economic instruments and the establishment of investment banks, means that we now are better poised than ever before to develop our national industries, and bring our country's economy to new heights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;
EVTDESC22570;One of the major companies in one of our states has gone bankrupt recently, following a long period of running at a deficit. Local politicians have petitioned the government to step in in support of the company, claiming that the downturn is only temporary, and that the company can get back on its feet if allowed some time to reconstruct and consolidate. While we could support the business, vocal members of parliament have lambasted the idea, calling it an absurd abridgment of the fundamental freedoms of trade and government non-interventionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC22580;$COUNTRY$ is abuzz with news of an alleged railroad trust, exposed by an anti-trust commission set up in one of our states. Local capitalists protest the allegations as absurd, claiming that no malicious coordination of prices, or price fixing has occurred. Many among the working classes are irate about the affair, feeling strongly that they are being squeezed hard by capitalist tycoons trying to make a profit out of their hardship. Breaking up the trust will set local railroad building back several years, but not doing it might anger broad strata of our population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC2600;$COUNTRY$ has maintained control over $STATENAME$ for us to consider the possibility of integrating it into $COUNTRY$ as a whole.

EVTDESC2611;With the new government in power and its more liberal views on minorities within $COUNTRY$, the policies of assimilation that attempted to stamp out minorities of other nationalities have all been rescinded.

EVTDESC2615;A demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ turned violent as minorities held up $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags and burned them-- a demonstration of their rejection of our attempts to assimilate them into $COUNTRY$.

EVTDESC2616;The recent arrest of a foreign national in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a diplomatic incident. Many of the minorities within $PROVINCENAME$ claim that the man was arrested solely because he opposed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assimilation policies, and was trying to spread word of a peaceful resistance. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities say the man's interest was not peaceful in the least, and they suspect he in fact works for one of our neighbours with a claim on $PROVINCENAME$. Whatever the truth, the reaction has not been peaceful in the least-- riots are expected, and authorities say to be wary of rebellion in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

EVTDESC3001;While there has been ample talk in this chamber about the costs of sickness, illness and disease, I have heard only very little being said on the costs of health care, and even less mention of the costs associated with, specifically, public health care.

How much private initiative is every year smothered on the altar of inefficient government bureaucracy, and how much more will it have to be before our government sets our health care free?'\n\nA counter-reform speech in parliament today has gained public interest, and a surprising amount of people are coming out in opposition to the present health-care system.

With living and health conditions in the cities worsening on account of overcrowding, pollution and poor housing, some people, predominantly from the middle classes, have come to yearn again for the peace and quiet of country life, and, with living standards and wages increasing, more and more people can also afford the occasional trip out of town for some rest and recreation in the fresh open air of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ country side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3003;Aye, I'd say they fed the pigs better than they ever did us.'\n\nA local scandal coming out of one of our states has garnered a fair amount of national attention during the last few weeks. Apparently, a foreman at one of the local workhouses has embezzled public funds allotted to him, and recovered the losses by serving poorer quality food, sometimes not more than a few slices of bread each day, to the people employed by the institution. The case has become a soap-box for conservatives and liberals alike, with conservatives arguing against government intervention and liberals arguing the need for more social reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3004;With a weak public opinion in favor of further social reform, some of our citizens in one of our states have taken the matter of caring for the downtrodden into their own hands, forming a 'Society of Friends'.

EVTDESC3005;Thus, an additional few thousand dead this year can be attributed to the ravages of tuberculosis in our state.'\n\nA local physician's privately published report on the state of health care in his home state has caused a small public uproar in $COUNTRY$.

EVTDESC3100;The state-run Morning Courier has published an article condemning, in harsh terms, what it claims to be the decadent behavior of the local elites in one of our states, calling them unpatriotic and claiming that certain circles among them secretly receive support from foreign powers to work against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ruling party. These news have taken hold with the lower classes of the province, who are becoming increasingly militant and projecting their anger at local power holders. Suppressing the newspaper will anger the lower classes, who will see it as a cover-up on our part, but not doing it will engender a feeling of exposure among the upper classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3101;The Daily Telegraph, which sees state-wide circulation in one of our states, has published an article exposing, in a rather picturesque manner, the details of a local politicians love-life, which apparently goes far beyond the confines of home and wife. While the article isn't slanderous per se, it is having a clear impact on the reputation and good name of the politician in question. The public has found the incident amusing, and the politician is now fast becoming the running gag of the town. The politician himself, angry at this attack upon his character, has petitioned the local court to ban the newspaper on grounds of 'breach of morality and public trust'. Shutting down the paper will rouse liberals in the state, but not doing it will increase the support for press reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3102;Having a free press means having to deal with the strangest things.

People, for one reason or another, actually seem to believe these accusations. Denying the rumors will be seen by the literate upper classes as a giving-in to plebianism, but not denying the rumors will cause said lower-classes to actually believe in them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Leaflets carrying anti-government slogans have been appearing in bars and coffeehouses all across one of our states, and we suspect that they are produced by an underground printing press in the region.

We've noticed that there has been a strong voiced support for liberal policies in one of our provinces recently, and we're not sure that the area should be allowed to actually vote along those lines. We could bring in some neighboring districts to form a strong conservative base in the entire state, but we would increase local militancy by doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC3800;A place to live and escape the weather, some clothing for warmth and comfort, some food, bread and cheese one day, perhaps meat a good day. We don't want much, we don't need much, just some necessities to be able to live and work.'\n\nA pamphlet has been published in $COUNTRY$, detailing the plight of our nation's poor. The pamphlet has gained a fair amount of national attention, and some members of parliament have started arguing in favor of legislation enforcing higher minimum wages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3801;As it, so rightly, has been stated: 'What a tangled web we weave'. Nowhere was this more true than in the bureaucratic mess that is our civil code since the wage reforms were implemented'\n\nMembers of parliament known for their cozy relations with $COUNTRY$'s capitalist classes have begun criticizing the minimum wage reform for its allegedly negative effects on the clarity, lucidity and simplicity of our nation's code of laws. They claim that the system is needlessly bureaucratic, and could be reformed. The reforms they suggest would, however, mean an effective abolishment of the system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3802;And while I do not claim to represent all the workers of $COUNTRY$, I do make the claim that I represent at least some of them, and those that I do represent tell me this: We need better wages.

The general feeling of the cabinet is that we should consider our minimum wage legislation, but there is also a faction arguing that it might, in fact, be better to go in the opposite direction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3803;Minimum wages? Why should we need that? We have always paid our workers exactly what they have earned, and they have always been able to afford housing, clothing and food.

EVTDESC3900;The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workers of the World, unite!'\n\nUnionism is spreading like wildfire in some parts of our country. More and more agitators seem to be showing up at factory doors, arguing for workers to unionise and rise in opposition to what they describe as the capitalist system of exploitation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law does not allow for the lawful establishment of trade unions at present, but some members of our cabinet argue that it is, perhaps, best to change that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3901;And, because the opinions of our men of labour need to be given a clear and unambiguous medium of expression, membership in the union should be made mandatory for all employees of the state'\n\nA strong political current in parliament have begun arguing for mandatory association with the National Union for any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public employee. The suggestion has received some support from circles within the trade union movement, and many are arguing that the suggestion might serve as a good compromise with those who argue for further liberalisation of the trade union laws. What is the government's position?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3902;A so-called 'Friendly Society' has been established in one of our provinces. The Friendly Society is a loose association of people, often working in the same or similar trades as each other, dedicated to providing members with mutual economic assistance in the forms of unemployment insurance, loans and cooperative banking. The Friendly Society claims that it isn't a trade union, but rather a cooperative or a bank, but some hawks within the cabinet fear that the organization is merely a front for socialist union activities, and should be shut down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC3903;So, I was thinking me and my boys could go down to the factory and talk to some people. You know, tell them about the law, and peace and quiet, and order.

EVTDESC4000;Slavery, this most vile and ancient institution of despotism and tyranny, is all but abolished in most of the civilized world, yet, here, in our very own $COUNTRY$, the practice continues with the explicit support of the law.

EVTDESC4001;Yes, here, in $COUNTRY$, all men are free and equal, but in lands beyond ours, the bonds of slavery and serfdom still wrap tightly around the wrists of the oppressed.'\n\nAbolitionists in $COUNTRY$ are arguing that the government should oppose slavery abroad, and support foreign abolitionist movements. Supporting foreign dissidents is obviously not something that will make us popular with the country on the receiving end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4100;The streets have turned into rivers of people in one of our provinces, where every man, woman and child seems to have come out of the woodwork, and into the streets, to participate in a massive street protest directed directly against the government. The issue on the table is the appointed, undemocratic Upper House, and the masses are calling for reform and representation. Our options here are rather limited. Either we listen to the demands of the infuriated mob, or we risk angering the locals even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4101;Discontent has been brewing in broad stratas of the population for some time over the issue of our appointed upper house. Many people are disappointed with the poor representation afforded to them by the present representational system, and a long period of agitation has begun to form public opinion on the issue. Violent state wide protests have erupted in one of our states, and we need to decide what the government's position on the issue should be. Writing the question off completely will anger the population, and strengthen the local opinion against the appointed house. Making compromises will mean a strengthening of the liberal position in the Upper House, and will also anger conservatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4102;The people in one of our states feel that the present system of equal state representation in the Upper House leaves them underrepresented. Whether or not their disaffection is merely misdirected anger over something else, or something that they are actually upset about, is not entirely clear, but what is clear is that they are quite upset. Making compromises over these fairly vague complaints will doubtlessly be seen by the world as pandering to the faintest of winds, but not addressing the issue, now that it has come up, will probably anger the locals further. What is the government's position?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4103;The people in our populous states are very satisfied with the high representation afforded to them by our constitution. One of the states is particularly happy, as their candidates have, during the past year, managed to secure several local privileges for their state. In the grand scheme of things, it's not any matter that merits national attention, but they are happy nevertheless. The question is how we should capitalize on this sudden burst of public support. What should be the government's position?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4200;A professor at one of our most prestigious universities has published a tract on political philosophy. The tract argues in favor of a variant of the Jefferson method for appointing representatives to the Upper House. The Jefferson method is a highest averages method, and the purpose of it is to allocate seats in proportion to the number of votes a particular party list has received, by maintaining the ratio of votes received to seats allocated as close as possible. The tract has received a fair amount of both national and international attention. The publication gives us a window of opportunity to try to reform our voting system, but we could perhaps be content with some international prestige on account of the publication instead? What is the government's position?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4201;A nationwide political reform club has formed in $COUNTRY$. The club has made it its agenda to reform the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ voting system, and they have initially been able to gain a fair amount of political traction in the public debate. The club wants to see our Jeffersonian voting system replaced with one of proportional representation. The club argues that a proportional representation allows for a fairer and more balanced representation for the totality of our population, rather than for arbitrary political voting circles. With the amount of traction that the club has been able to garner, we would be hard pressed if we gave it no attention, on the other hand, reform might not be on our agenda right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4202;With the Upper House firmly in liberal hands, our population seems to have given us a clear and unequivocal mandate for political reform. This could be a good opportunity to reform our voting system, but the question is: In which direction? With the clear mandate we have, we could choose to go in more or less any direction, and the options that seem to lie on the table are a first past the post system and a Jeffersonian method. While we will still have to drag the reforms through our legislative bodies, this could be a good opportunity to build momentum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4300;The mob assembled outside the national legislative assembly is frustrated and angry, and the anger is directed directly at us. Our population is up in ire over the issue of charter reform. They want the vote, and some hot-heads in the crowd are even hinting at taking it by force if they don't get it. Despite certain radicals, the movement for charter reform is still largely keeping itself within the bounds of peaceful protest. The options our government finds itself faced with are to either support the charter reform movement, or to oppose it, and the choice really shouldn't be too hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4301;Our voting system is heavily based on and around the ownership of land. A case has gained some notoriety in one of our states, where a young widow has been denied the voting rights tied to her estate, on account of the estate quickly losing market value due to falling prices in the area. The event has led to a wider discussion on the landed voting system in general, and several reform minded ideas are circulating in intellectual and progressive circles. The issue on the table is what stance the government should take on the case's principal issue. Should we attempt to fix voting indexes, and anger the poor strata of the local population, or allow them to fluctuate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4302;Suffrage in $COUNTRY$ is directly based on the ownership of wealth and property. The fundamental principle is that only those who contribute to the common good should have a say in how that public good is managed and administered. One interesting consequence of this system has surfaced in one of our states, where several local merchants and traders from the middle classes have started earning enough to be allowed representation. Adjusting the rules will be seen as an adjustment to exclude certain social classes, and will not be appreciated by the richer classes. Disenfranchising the newly enfranchised middle classes risks a sharp rise in local militancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4303;A discussion is being held in one of our state assemblies on the issue of our wealth based voting system. Opponents argue that the present system is set by design to permanently and lastingly disenfranchise broad stratas of the population. We have the options of leaving the discussion, and hoping that it stays on a local level, or intervening to defend the present system, and raise the discussion to a national level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4304;So, you see, it would be detrimental to the long-term peace and stability of our home state if the government were to announce that it seeks to support the calls for further voting reforms, that have elsewhere been voiced by slovenly revolutionary trash. Their screams are merely those of angry children.'\n\nOur government has been approached by a group of capitalists, aristocrats and other leading tycoons of local public life in one of our states. The group calls itself the Alliance of Concerned Citizens, and has sought the government's ear to inform it that there still are those who oppose any further reform to the political franchise. What should we tell them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4305;People are getting along just fine in at least one of our provinces, it seems. A local political deadlock, that has persisted in one of our states since the last election, has been resolved in a compromise across party lines. With a compromise reached, the local political assemblies can get back to work. Locals are taking to the streets, celebrating the event as a great victory for democracy, and recalling those immortal words by Friedrich Schiller: 'Joy, beautiful sparkle of the gods, Daughter of Elysium. All men become brothers, where your tender wing lingers.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC43805;Now that we are a self-governing colony, the question has arisen as to whether New Zealand should unite with the Australian Commonwealth. Many within the government are concerned at Australia's treatment of aborigines, however, and have suggested that if New Zealand was to join the commonwealth they should offer equal rights for the Maori. This might lead to their refusal, but the alternative would be a setback to the years of friendly relations we have built up with the Maori peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC43806;The New Zealand government has approached us about the possibility of becoming part of the Australian Commonwealth. Their one stipulation is that equal rights be given to the Maori people-- out of concern, no doubt, for our historical treatment of the aborigines.

Food shortages are becoming ever more widespread in $COUNTRY$, and pent up anger is spilling onto the streets. Many blame our government's protectionist policies for the failures in the food market, and some are even calling for the cabinet to resign.

EVTDESC4402;In $COUNTRY$, trade flows freely from one to the other, and few, if any, restrictions exist on trade between our merchants. In one of our neighbor countries, however, there still exists heavy import restrictions on wares and goods, and this is apparently especially true for weapons and firearms. Our two systems have locked horns in one of our border provinces, where a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchant has set up shop, trading weapons across the border. While we could inform our neighbor about the situation, we have very few legal means of stopping the merchant in question. After all, free trade applies to guns as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4403;One of our merchants has found himself in dire straits since the collapse of his family business. The business is, or was, a local powerhouse of industry, and many locals now find themselves without jobs and means of earning a living. While this is, prima facie, a tragedy, we could perhaps do something about it. Our government's policy of economic interventionism allows us to use public means to support fledgling or failing businesses. We could intervene in this situation, and support the business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4404;...and here we have the bureau chief for the private sector'\n\nOur state industries have, for quite some time, been plagued by inertia and corruption. The result of these evils is a lack of clothes, soap and in some cases even food. With the everyday needs of our population left unsatisfied, it is a mere question of time until we begin seeing some serious displays of dissatisfaction from our population. What is becoming abundantly clear is that we need to deal with these problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4405;The bureau of economic planning has reported a gross miscalculation in last year's mid-term plan, leading to a severe over-reporting of military goods in our national stock-pile. It has not been easy to find out how this error came about, since everyone in the administration seems to have their hands full with pushing the blame. We could attempt to recover our 'losses' by enacting pay-cuts and rationalizations within the administration and the bureaucracy, but we can not expect a move like that to become popular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

This is of course excellent news, and the question is how we should leverage this publication to gain maximum benefit from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4407;Our armed forces have conducted a major recruitment drive across the entire country, and recruits have been flocking to the banners. The drive could not have been conducted, says the military, without the government's policy of strong support for the military. We can channel the positive public relations from this drive to either reduce our people's war exhaustion, or to push for further military gains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4408;...and it seems to me an outright travesty that, while our people labour under the crushing yokes and fetters of poverty, unsanitary living conditions, and moral degradation, our parliament insists on spending thousands upon thousands upon millions on gunpowder and cannons.

How should we leverage this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;
EVTDESC4409;We stand before the defining issue, not only of our own time, but of all times. Do we continue to pull on the knots of war that the great nations of the world have tied between them, or do we, instead, lower our weapons and say, openly, that we desire peace, that we burn for peace, that we would die, for peace.'\n\nOur government's pacifist policies have gained a large amount of political traction both within parliament, and in the general population. This popular support can be cashed in, either by reducing militancy, or by further advancing the pacifist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4410;Here we stand at the brink of a brave new world. Behind us lie a thousand years of darkness, criminal ignorance and superstitions. Before us lie a new future, free of all these evils. Here, at the fork in the road, we make our choice. God is dead, gentlemen! Do we now advance forward, in clear acceptance of the facts uncovered by the modern sciences, that there is not, and cannot be, a divine creator, or do we cling to our most beloved nightmare, and continue to close our eyes in trembling fear of demons, angels and ghosts of sins past. We are free people, gentlemen. Let us act our part.'\n\nOur government's anti-clerical agenda has, not surprisingly, caused friction with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Neither of our options now is very pleasant: either we abandon our claims to Oregon no matter what some might think, or we press ahead with the claims and brace for eventual war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44154;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Columbia District. The entire region west of the Rockies (called the Oregon Country by the Americans) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. Recently the situation has been exacerbated by American politicians rattling their sabres over their idea of 'Manifest Destiny', and they have pressed their claim all the way north to the 54th Parallel. It will almost certainly mean war, and our only consideration should probably be whether we wish to pursue another costly war with the Americans in North America when our time could better be spent elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44155;The British have elected to withdraw from Oregon and have signed a treaty to hand any American land over to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;;
EVTDESC4416;And, therefore, the issue of economic freedom must, in this instance, be separated from the broader issue of public morality. The free trade of goods across our borders means a constant influx of all filth, depravity and immorality, and this dirty flood that washes over our people, must be stopped.'\n\nA debate has flared up between moralists and free traders in one of our states. Moralists argue that our current free trade policies allow our traders and merchants too much leeway in the types of goods the purvey, and wish to see a ban enacted on goods deemed to constitute a threat to public morality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4417;And, therefore, our nation's conflicts are also our conflicts. Not merely on account of the justness of our fatherland's cause, but also on account of the fundamental moral rightness for which it stands.'\n\nOur government's policies on issues of public morality have led to a massive support for the war effort from moralist circles. Some in these circles have even started to refer to $COUNTRY$'s conflict as a moral crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4418;In light of the recent acts of violence committed by certain elements within our community, I, therefore, would like to suggest to this chamber a temporary abridgment of the right to assemble in public places. It is a well established fact that the heart of the city pulses along with the heart of the mob, and that by removing the mob, the city will return to calm.'\n\nA conservative clique in the Upper House has, on account on the prevailing social unrest in $COUNTRY$, begun pushing for what they refer to as a temporary ban on public meetings. While the ban is claimed to be temporary, many within the other parties fear that it may very well become institutionalized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4419;I just want some bread. I've been standing here for four hours now. I don't think they have any bread.'\n\nThe queues can be seen snaking their way for blocks and blocks again. The government controlled food supplies have been having trouble coming in to one of our provinces, on account of inefficiencies and bureaucratic staleness in the Transport & Logistics departments. It is very clear that locals expect us and the central government to act and do something about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4420;I feel strongly that we have lost what I like to think of as our place in the sun. $COUNTRY$ used to be a respected force in the international community, but these days it is as if our voice was consequently, and by design, ignored. I feel that, in order to regain that which was lost, we must again assert ourselves on the international scene. Some might accuse me of adventurism, but, by Jingo, this country was built by adventurers.'\n\nThe politburo has held a meeting to discuss our international situation, and the mood around the table has been grim. Some of the more hawkish members of the buro are discussing a foreign campaign, to assert our international position, and to divert attention from internal dissent within the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44200;In the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977, we compromised to give the Panama canal back to Panama, at the begining of year 2000.\nShall we keep our word, and lose the important state, or not do so and lose prestige in the eyes of the world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTDESC4421;With our campaign-workers harassed, our party headquarters closed and our officials disturbed in their work at every turn of the road, it comes as surprise to me that we still garner any votes at all! These policies of open political harassment are a shame. A blot of shame on our national conscience, a disgrace to our nation and an insult to what I, had it been that democratic elections were actually being held in $COUNTRY$, would refer to as our electorate.'\n\nLeading liberal politicians in one of our states have protested in fierce language against the harassment policies of our election system. The politicians are up in ire about this, and call upon the national government to react.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4422;And we will not accept the agitations of the capitalists and the war-profiteers, trying, with their vicious imperialist propaganda, to pit the workers of one country against the workers of another! The workers of the world are all brothers, and we all speak the same language. The sweat on a brother's brow is the sweat on ours, and the blood from a brother's heart, pumps through our veins! Capitalists, comrades, make the money, and we, comrades, spill the blood.'\n\nA strike has broken out in one of our provinces, organized by subversive elements within the trade-union movement. While the strike is officially organized under the parole of peace and solidarity, some in our cabinet suspect that the demonstration is a crypto-socialist manifestation of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4423;The Censorship Bureau has found itself swamped with work in the past few years, and the executive director of the bureau has complained on numerous occasions that his subordinates are incapable of keeping up with the constantly increasing amount of material coming in for review. The issue of the overworked bureau has now reached critical mass with the publication of an article expressing slanderous anti-government propaganda, bordering on personal libel directed at several cabinet members. When asked how the newspaper could pass the censorship process, The Censorship Bureau has pointed to several old reports detailing it's lack of resources. Several cabinet members, however, claim that the bureau has more than enough resources to handle the tasks assigned to it, and that the problems are fundamentally organizational.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4424;And this is what the wanton speculation of our so-called captains of industry has led to! Gentlemen, these are the results! Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, have been squandered away in high-risk investments, speculative real-estate purchases and bonds that, upon closer inspection, hold no real value save that of hot air. I call upon this assembly to step in and rectify these issues, with a strong policy of regulation and government intervention.'\n\nA member of parliament has criticized our government's economic policy, citing a series of failed investments allegedly made by the private sector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4425;One has to wonder what went through their minds. To publish a text like this in a country like $COUNTRY$? In any event, what is done is done. A widely circulated $COUNTRY_ADJ$ daily has published a blasphemous text containing a scathing denunciation of all things religious. The text is written by a member of our intelligentsia of some renown, and is perhaps a sign of the godless times we live in. Moralists demand that the text be retracted with a formal apology issued to the offended religious institutions, while several members of the reform-minded elites argue that the author was simply exercising his right to free speech. After all, the press is free in $COUNTRY$, so there is a case to be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4430;And love dares you to change our way of caring, about ourselves.'\n-- Queen\n\nThe political climate in $COUNTRY$ has taken a turn for the worse lately, as more and more of our loyal subjects are beginning to question the wisdom of our less than representational Upper House. The Upper House is increasingly being seen as the one institution primarily responsible for the constant smothering of all attempts and initiatives aiming at political reform, and people are demanding that the institution's founding charters be redrawn to allow for a broader representation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44300;After the Conservative administration had been voted into majority in Parliament in 1872, charges were levied against John A. Macdonald of the most serious nature. Macdonald’s pet project had been the trans-continental railway, and the Liberal administration charged that Sir Hugh Allan had given him campaign funds in exchange for a guaranteed contract with his company, Canadian Pacific. Despite Macdonald’s claims of innocence, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister. Donald A. Smith’s lack of confidence in Macdonald only further contributed to the decline of the party’s popularity;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44301;The Métis people were a group of small communities of French-Indian blood in the Manitoba region who had hopes of self-government. Unfortunately their dreams were shattered when the Hudson's Bay land, which they were a part of, were given to Canada without their consent. In protest the Métis people, led by Louis Riel, revolted. Louis Riel was a highly religious man, who had studied for the clergy in his earlier life. He fought for the Métis people and became a hero in the eyes of Manitobans. Louis bargained with the Canadian government for Manitoba's entry into Confederation. Canadian delegates guaranteed the rights of the people would be respected. Thus, Manitoba, the postage-stamp province, was born.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44302;Although the Canadian government promised to respect the rights of the Métis, it did not appear to do so. Métis petitions for recognition of their land-holdings and institutions went unheeded. The Métis also became increasingly upset with the growing numbers of settlers from the east, invading their territories. In early 1885, the situation came to a head when the Métis once again took up arms in revolt. Adopting the Revolutionary Bill of Rights, the Métis established their own government and independence from Canada. Canadian troops came and crushed the rebellion. Louis Riel was tried and executed. The Métis would not be recognized officially as a people until a hundred years later.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44303;It has taken time to settle the grievances following the Riel Rebellion, but treaties with the various Metis groups throughout the North-West territories have managed to properly incorporate them into Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC44305;Perhaps inspired by the American Revolution, colonists in both the Lower Canada and Upper Canada colonies have risen up in rebellion. They are frustrated by the lack of political reform, as well as the entrenched power held by the reactionary elites of the 'Family Compact', and agitators are demanding responsible government if not outright independence. The colonial government has moved to arrest the perpetrators as traitors to the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44306;Lord Durham has returned from his mission to investigate the causes of the rebellion in Upper and Lower Canada with recommendations to the British crown-- namely that the two colonies be united under a single responsible government through an Act of Union. He fears that, if we do not, we may be facing further rebellion just as was faced in America. Indeed, it is entirely possible the Canadian radicals could attract support from the Americans if they are not appeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44310;A gathering of governors from our Maritime colonies in North America has also been attended by governors from Canada. According to reports, they are attempting to organize a larger confederation of the colonies with an eye towards eventual self-government. We would like to see the North American colonies be more self-reliant, so it may be in our best interest to allow this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44315;The colonial government of Canada has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see renewed rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC44316;The colonial government of Quebec has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance.

EVTDESC44320;A bill has been passing through the British Parliament which would see the entirety of Rupert's Land-- all North American colonial territory between British Columbia and Ontario-- being given offered to the Canadian dominion. Currently the land is administered by the Hudson's Bay Company, and thus the Canadian government would be required to purchase it. Should they choose to do so, it would strengthen our ally greatly and relieve our overextended colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44321;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has passed an act which would see the Canadian government offered control over all of Rupert's Land-- essentially all $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory in North America east of British Columbia. We would need to purchase the land from the Hudson's Bay Company at no small expense, though it would be one of the largest land purchases in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC44322;A British act which would have seen us offered the rights to purchase all of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company has been defeated. Canadian dreams of uniting the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific have been dashed in one fell swoop! Citizens in $CAPITAL$ are outraged at this betrayal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;;
EVTDESC44325;Relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ are friendly, and thus the dream of a larger Canadian confederation has resurfaced. Delegates from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have made the journey to $CAPITAL$ with the goal of negotiating terms of joining our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC44339;The land north of the 60th parallel is inhospitable to settlers, but there is a growing concern that should the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government not move to fully claim the territory another power will do so. It will take considerable political capital to convince the other world powers of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ dominion in the north, but many feel we must make the effort... and considering there are reports of gold in the Yukon it might be wise to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC4435;A family was caught attempting to sneak across the border today, the latest in a spate of such incidents.

EVTDESC44351;Representatives from British Columbia have met with Canadian delegates in $CAPITAL$ to discuss terms of their joining confederation.

EVTDESC4436;The plight of an immigrant family that has spent three years trying to get permission for relatives to join them in $COUNTRY$ has recently come to the attention of the government. The family meets all criteria for immigration except for one: the quotas have reached their limit, and officials have no recourse but to sometimes deny those who would otherwise be welcome. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ expatriates in other countries have held demonstrations against the policy, claiming it is based in racism and old-fashioned thinking. Conservatives say it is the only way to prevent immigrants from overrunning the system and causing chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC4437;'We have lived in $COUNTRY$ our entire lives. We arrived here as children, and we speak no other language and know no other way.

EVTDESC4438;'I came to $COUNTRY$ fifteen years ago, leaving behind starvation and worse. Now I am a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen, as are my children, and I could not be more proud to fight for my new homeland.'\n\nThe story of a naturalized immigrant who has become a veteran and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriot has been making the rounds in $CAPITAL$ newspapers this month.

EVTDESC44805;A general and war hero of Mexican independence, Santa Anna was elected President in 1833. After deposing his liberal vice-president, Santa Anna abrogated the 1826 Constitution and took control of the country as a conservative dictator with both church and military backing. Many Mexican states objected to this centralization of power, and with the rebellion of Tejas to the north the entire country seems to be in a state of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44808;Not unexpectedly, Mexico has ignored the terms of the Treaties of Velasco-- claiming that Santa Anna only agreed to them under duress. Indeed, Santa Anna himself has been quick to back up their claim even despite his precarious position. The one bright light in this? It might be the cause the American government has been looking for to intervene in our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

EVTDESC44825;With our northern lands under American control, it seems we have little choice but to negotiate. The Americans have offered us a deal: the normalization of relations, the forgiveness of our debt and the payment of a great deal of money... all in exchange for the relinquishment of our claims to all territories north of the Rio Grande.

EVTDESC44830;Emperor Maximilian has never enjoyed popular support in Mexico, and now that insurgents led by Benito Juárez have captured him it seems his reign has come to an end.

EVTDESC44835;Porfirio Díaz, General of Mexico and considered a hero by some, has overthrown the democratic government of Mexico in a military coup.

EVTDESC44840;In a surprise development, the leader of Mexico-- General Antonio de Santa Anna himself-- has been captured. Found running through the countryside, attempting to escape back to Mexico, he has been imprisoned in a Texan jail and forced to negotiate. We can force the man to agree to a peace treaty-- even though many consider the odds of Santa Anna's own country agreeing to terms exacted under duress to be slight, it may be our only hope against overwhelming odds. At the very least, the humiliation dealt against their leader will be a blow against the Mexican government and one from which they will not soon recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44841;In a humiliating blow to Mexico's prestige, General Santa Anna has been captured within Texan territory-- separated from our army and found wandering the countryside in an attempt to return to Mexico. While imprisoned, he agreed to a series of treaties which recognized Texan independence among other guarantees... all in exchange for his safe return. We are now faced with a question: while the treaties are worthless, disregarding them completely could give the Americans a cause to intervene. Either way, one thing is certain: as the architect of this fiasco, Santa Anna's time in power is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44842;While Mexico had every reason to refute the treaties signed by Santa Anna, it seems their willingness to continue the war against Texas has waned. They will not embarass themselves further, and have agreed to let us remain free in exchange for Santa Anna's return. For the moment, this means the war with Mexico is over... whether that peace will continue remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44843;As expected, the Mexican government has refuted the Treaties of Velasco and refused to negotiate for Santa Anna's return. They are, however, evidently afraid that the treaties have enough validity that ignoring them would give the Americans an excuse to intervene-- and have called for a ceasefire. How long it will last is unknown, but for the moment Texas has its respite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC44845;Despite the assurances supposedly offered by the Treaties of Velasco, we once again find ourselves at war with Mexico. The ceasefire is, it seems, now over. While many in our government never expected Mexico to live up to the terms of the treaties anyhow, they do suggest that this might be enough cause for the Americans to intervene. Such an intervention would, of course, be inviting the wolves through the front door. but do we have any other choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea-- many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC85026;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there.

EVTDESC90064;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans.

EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly.

EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire's power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged. If we choose to defy the European edict, we could be facing wars from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90068;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consesus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90076;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine-- something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90079;Despite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory... and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the 'Sick Man of Europe' has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90081;Egypt has been defeated, and the so-called Oriental Crisis brought to an end with the Ottoman Empire unquestionably the victor. The question now arises as to what should be done with them. There are those who argue that attempting to assume direct control over Egyptian lands would be folly, and that instead we should assume control over the Levant and any lands we have direct claim to... but keep them in our sphere of influence. Others say this only begs for a repeat of the crisis we just faced. They say that Egypt must be turned into an Ottoman colony, rebellions or no.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90082;A recent Misri uprising in $PROVINCENAME$ was put down harshly by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces, but the unrest has spread throughout all of $STATENAME$. They are resisting the direct rule of Egypt by $COUNTRY$, and we should expect further problems here in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90083;Still stinging from their defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Egyptian aristocracy has focused the blame on the rapid westernization of the nation and the instability they claim it has brought. They are demanding that the government cling more strongly to tradition and repeal some of these reforms, and there are fears that if they are not satisified they may instigate a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has declared that it will not accept Egyptian surrender, and has rejected terms that the rest of Europe feels are quite fair-- instead pushing onwards to recapture all of Egypt. There are many within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who feel this is a betrayal... $COUNTRY$ intervened to help maintain $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from collapsing, but perhaps they do not need our help at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90086;We have received word through the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy pledging their support for the Ottoman Empire in our conflict with the Egyptians. This is heartening news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;;
EVTDESC90087;Our forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands. We can try to hold out and turn the tide, but it is far more likely that Egypt will simply be carved up into pieces by the imperialists if we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90088;The Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control. Our advisors say that wresting control of the entire country is almost impossible, and that we should take the offer while we can and let the Egyptians go.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90089;The Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient... for now. All that remains is for us to decide whether to end hostilities with the Egyptians and return any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lands that we hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;;
EVTDESC90090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC90091;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire.

EVTDESC90092;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire.

EVTDESC90093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC90094;Egypt has fallen, settling matters with the Turks through a peace treaty which has seen the Levant taken from them and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Egypt vastly reduced.

Remember the Maine!\n\nA riot by Cuban Spanish loyalists recently broke out in Havana, leading to the destruction of the printing presses of four local newspapers which criticized the Spanish Army. The battleship USS Maine was sent to Havana in response to fears expressed by the American consulate that Americans in Cuba might be endangered. Not long after arriving, the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 268 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbour.

EVTDESC95279;'Our joining of the Union was with the understanding that it meant something-- we were joining a cause for true freedom in a world full of totalitarianism, a cause far greater than any we could hope to achieve on our own. We were mistaken, and now we must march forward on our own terms.

EVTDESC95315;With things in $COUNTRY$ so difficult, some citizens have brought up the possibility of joining the Confederation of Canada.

EVTDESC95500;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. The outcome has become known as the 'General Act of the $CAPITAL$ Conference', formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95501;A conference has been held in $FROMCOUNTRY$, attended by all colonial powers, to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. A general agreement has been reached, formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95502;Word has reached $COUNTRY$ of a great meeting of colonial powers in Europe, wherein it was decided that African nations would be divided up amongst them-- as if our people were little more than children's toys discarded and left waiting to be picked up. This has caused a great deal of concern among those of our people with the knowledge to understand what this means. For others it has brought little more than resentment, as well as vows to fight for our independence when the day comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95503;'We have seen the outsiders. They come, with guns and riches we have never seen before. What they also bring is death, and we must always be wary what lies behind their smiles.'\n\n$COUNTRY$ stands on good terms with much of the western world, but our leaders are all too aware how quickly that could change. The Europeans believe we are not civilized, and the tone of our contact with them is slowly changing from friendly interest in trade to a strange paternalism coupled with cultural superiority. For now, $COUNTRY$ survives... but we must watch for the moment when the civilized nations decide our enslavement is the only way we can be 'saved'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95504;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ muslims are calling for the Jihad to continue: all Islamic states of the Sahel, united under one flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC95505;European presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses-- but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95506;Our presence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached the point where $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence is felt in every level of their society. They are a protectorate in all but name, and the time has come for us to determine whether that status should be made official. Shall we agree to make $FROMCOUNTRY$ a protectorate and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, or support their independence as a friendly ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95507;A disturbing report has reached us of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence-- meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority. There are some who say this is a golden opportunity to establish a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate, while others say $FROMCOUNTRY$ is simply not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95508;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ shipping company has come into the ownership of the Red Sea port of Assab, sold to them by a local Afar sultan. The port would make for an excellent coaling station, and perhaps even provide a base for $COUNTRY$ to expand our influence in the area. Pushing for more direct control, however, could cause tensions with Assab's owner-- who might feel they have greater right to the port than the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95509;The Red Sea port of Assab has been sold to $FROMCOUNTRY$ by the local Afar sultan. They have begun to use the port as a coaling station, and fears within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are that they will use this base to expand their influence within $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC95510;With the Sudan in chaos, the Ethiopians have taken advantage of the situation to regain control over the Eritrean coastlands. Though we may yet regain control over the Sudan, we should consider whether the Eritreans must be punished for this trespass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95512;The 'Age of Princes' is upon us. The rulers of Ethiopia must struggle to unite the land under a single Emperor-- and now it is $COUNTRY$'s time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;;
EVTDESC95514;Now that Imperial rule has been restored, we must endeavour to spread control over lands that neighbour our own but which are rightfully part of our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC95610;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the Russians will continue their southward expansion. If we do not press north from India, we will soon find the Russians on our doorstep... And, at that point, it will be a quick step for them to invade the British Raj directly. Steps must be taken to set up puppet governments between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95611;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the British will continue their northward expansion. If we do not press south, Russia will soon have its southern borders exposed to European invasion. It does us no good to allow the British complete hegemony over Central Asia. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC95612;The Great Game between the British Empire and Russia has one pushing ever northward and the other pushing ever southward, with $COUNTRY$ caught in-between. Recently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers got into a skirmish with one of our neighbours... and the resulting incident has brought the infernal gaze of one of these powers upon us, perhaps meaning war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95613;Thanks to the Great Game and its maneuvering, tensions with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been rising. Recently, an incident occurred near their border where several $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers were attacked by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. There were several deaths, and while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is apologetic there are those within $COUNTRY$ who are calling for us to move in and assume control of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95614;It seems that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is content to accept the incident was not our intent and turn its attentions elsewhere. For the moment, $COUNTRY$ is safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC95616;Unrest within $FROMCOUNTRY$ against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has reached a boiling point, and it appears the only solution is to step in and rule them directly. Should we fail to do so, we may find $FROMCOUNTRY$ soon taken from our control and turned into a target for a foreign power's expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them-- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95641;First they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochinchina in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers? Rebellion seems almost certain to end with Cambodia being torn to pieces by both.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the French intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the French and asked for protection, and the French have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95650;Many in our government believe we should press our influence in Indochina, expanding our colony there to include some of our less civilized neighbours. Perhaps the time is right for war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC95652;French diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not 'rightfully ours'. This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the French claim to be 'protectors' of these people! Yet. do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the French onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the French at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC96000;$COUNTRY$ is in a state of total war with one of the Great Powers of the world. In a modern age where warfare has the capability of killing millions, the very future of our nation could be at stake. The call has gone out to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: put aside your petty differences," your day-to-day lives and your personal ambitions. $COUNTRY$ must pull together in this, our hour of need!;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC96004;The constant state of war $COUNTRY$ is under has taken its toll on our people. Shortages of basic goods and the failure to deliver swift victory have worn down the enthusiasm with which the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people initially greeted the war effort. If things don't turn around soon, we could face growing weariness and unrest within our own borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC96005;Growing demonstrations in $CAPITAL$ demonstrate the prevailing attitude of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: get us out of the war, and soon. Too many have been lost, too many sacrifices made, and all for what? The people wish to go back to their regular lives, without the constant spectre of war hanging over their heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96006;The war effort is not going well, to put it lightly. Advisors are saying that $COUNTRY$ should sue for peace, do whatever it takes to end this war before something even more terrible happens. The people are on the brink of revolt. We must act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96010;We have lost the war, and like vultures the victors have descended upon us. We have been forced to the bargaining table to accept humiliating terms regarding the breakup of our empire, with many of our lands simply given away, and we shall be permitted no overseas holdings whatsoever. This is a moment that shall be remembered in $COUNTRY$ for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and we have been invited to the negotiating table to discuss the potential breakup of their empire. This could potentially mean we see $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands returned to us, though if we forego our claims it could mean salvaging a relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and now treaty talks have begun to discuss the breakup of their empire. As an enemy of $FROMCOUNTRY$, our place at the table is assured. At the very least, any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands currently in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ possession should be returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96015;The defeat of $FROMCOUNTRY$ in their war has forced them to the negotiating table, and one of the terms for the breakup of their empire is our release from their direct rule. This would mean casting out $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials and potentially turning them into an enemy. We could maintain our close ties with $FROMCOUNTRY$ even with our freedom, though this would mean passing up a chance for freedom and goodwill from $FROMCOUNTRY$'s enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96016;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$'s colonial holdings. They should not be allowed to keep these lands, but determinining how they should be disposed of is no simple matter. For now, agreement has been reached determining some of the territory, and any remaining will have to be negotiated over in the coming year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96017;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$'s colonial holdings. We are not a great power, and it's possible that even if pursue some of their colonies for our own we'll end up with nothing... but if we do not try, we'll end up with nothing for sure. Even so, making the attempt could be seen as aggressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96020;With the war finished, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have taken to the streets of $CAPITAL$ in celebration. The toll of the war has been heavy, but today $COUNTRY$ is simply happy to be at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96022;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been created from the ether, but the powers-that-be have determined at least some of their lands rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$ and should be returned to us. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have rejoiced at this news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC96025;Now that we are in a state of total war, the idea has arisen that $COUNTRY$ should approach $FROMCOUNTRY$'s enemies to see if there are those who would join our side against them. This may mean an unholy alliance with those who might never fight at our side otherwise, but as the old saying goes: 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.' If we are to win the war against $FROMCOUNTRY$, we may have to take that to heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96030;A diplomat from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with a proposal: an alliance with them, to fight in a war against their enemy... who is certainly no friend of ours. While the alliance does not necessarily obligate us, the question really remains whether or not $COUNTRY$ even wishes to go to war. If we fight with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we stand the chance of gaining the spoils of war for ourselves. It also means we could fall with them. The choice is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96031;We have received word from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that they have agreed to an alliance. Whether or not they will actually live up to that alliance and join us in the war remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTDESC96065;A diplomatic incident with one of our enemies has outraged $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several weeks ago, an envoy assigned to $CAPITAL$ was accused of stealing national secrets. It turned out the truth was far worse, and an investigation has unearthed a conspiracy to destablize $COUNTRY$ and leave it week for invasion. This has leaked out to the public, and now crowds in the capital are calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;
EVTDESC96066;The assassination of a prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen by a dissident has, after a thorough investigation, turned out to be at the instigation of an enemy power.

The results of the investigation have leaked to the public, and massive crowds gathered in the streets of $CAPITAL$ are now calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;
EVTDESC96070;According to the peace treaty, our colonies and overseas territories must be surrendered. Negotiations are currently underway as to which nations they will be 'assigned' to. It appears our humiliation is not yet complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC96081;An isolated $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory has been offered to us. We should consider whether we wish to adminster it, as accessing the land may be difficult according to current borders. But, then again, do we truly wish $FROMCOUNTRY$ to keep it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC96085;As the armies of our former enemy depart $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed democratic government friendly to their nation.

EVTDESC96086;As the armies of our former enemy leave $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed right-wing government friendly to their nation.

EVTDESC96090;With the loss of $COUNTRY$ in the recent war, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy has received much of the blame-- there have already been several assassination attempts, and calls within the government for the monarchy to step down.

During the turmoil, the police killed the assassins... but the King and the royal heir were not saved and were pronounced dead at the Naval Arsenal soon afterwards. Manuel, the king's youngest son, has been quickly acclaimed as the new King of Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97020;With the monarchy already weakened by the death of King Carlos, republican opponents have been able to gather considerable support in the capital.

EVTDESC97050;The confederation of Peru, South Peru and Bolivia represents a threat to our interests. If the confederation is given time to solidify, they could easily become a new powerhouse in South America-- and one that is no friend to $COUNTRY$.

EVTDESC97060;Brazil has traditionally held the right to intervene in Uruguayan internal affairs as it sees fit, but in recent months the conservative Blanco government has proven to be increasingly intransigent.

EVTDESC97061;After several recent political conflicts with Brazil, they have sent an ultimatum: place the rebel leader of the Colorados in charge of the government or there will be war.

This insulting ultimatum should be refused, according to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

EVTDESC97152;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Predictably, they have refused. This is a direct challenge to Spanish authority from a former colony. If we do not react in kind, we will lose a great deal of credibility. Perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over $FROMCOUNTRY$? Cutting them down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident. The problem, however, is that he carries with him the title of Royal Commissary. This is a title reserved for officials dealing with Spanish colonies, not ambassadors to sovereign nations. This is a deliberate insult to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

EVTDESC97156;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has arrived with the expected news: they have agreed to submit themselves to Spanish rule once again, if we so choose.

EVTDESC97160;Spanish imperialism has raised its head once again, with the Spanish throne having gone to war with a neighbour in an effort to restore their lost influence.

EVTDESC97166;The Monroe Doctrine dictates that the United States is responsible for protecting the western hemisphere from encroachment from imperialists in Europe -- such as what Spain is doing right now in South America. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and appealed to us for aid, asking for an alliance in case Spain should decide to expand its influence even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC97170;A Sudanese religious leader by the name of Muhammad Ahmad has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or 'guided one') and begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism-- and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$.

EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely.

EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order.

EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places-- including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet-- and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current wargoals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$'s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail).

Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia's treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks.

EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia.

EVTDESC97600;Meaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death.

EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima.

This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama.

EVTDESC97660;With the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan's old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted.

EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion.

EVTDESC98200;The Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with British rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the northeast, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the British government is concerned, the Boers are British subjects... no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC98205;The Boers are eager to get away from British rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Cape Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower... and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Boers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC98206;The Boer encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Piet Retief and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony-- with the only question remaining whether $COUNTRY$ will recognize their independence or treat them as subjects. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC98207;The Boers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Boers are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Boers to their side... perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are chafing under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they still do not have true independence. There have been several altercations with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military foces, and the recommendation of the Cape Town government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way-- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTDESC98211;After a series of altercations between $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial forces and the Boer militia, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to cut its losses and allow Natal its independence.

EVTDESC98245;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrasing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98246;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTDESC98247;The Boers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Cape Colony to them.

EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials.

Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98620;With the Ottoman government having indicated its willingness to provide reforms, an intellectual class known as the Young Ottomans has arisen-- men influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution who are advocating the assumption of secular rather than religious laws as well as the provision of rights to ethnic minorities. This, they say, will help stem the tide of decay in the Empire. Most recently they have suggested embracing the Empire's Bulgarian minorities, maintaining that such a gesture would indicate a willingness to embrace European values. Mashriqi citizens have gotten wind of this, demanding that they as Muslims should receive preferential treatment. Reactionary officials have agreed, suggesting a move towards accepting the Empire's role as an Islamic power rather than away from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98621;Recently the Young Ottomans have been pushing for reform in the millet system, the governmental system under which the Empire's territories are allowed to govern themselves. The Young Ottomans say that the Albanians have been loyal servants to the Empire and their millets deserve equal treatment to those of the Turks. This would also indicate a willingness to embrace European ideals. Reactionaries have rejected this notion, suggesting the Empire embrace the Bedouin population instead. This would indicate a commitment by the Empire towards traditional values.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98622;The Young Ottomans have begun campaigning for equality to be granted to Bosnian citizens-- a European culture which is also Muslim, and the embracing of which would further indicate an alignment towards Europe. Reactionaries have been quick to suggest that if equality is going to be granted to any distant group, it should be the Maghrebi. Doing so would indicate an alignment towards reclaiming the Empire's former expanse and away from Europe and its dangerous ideas. Appeasing both groups appears to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants-- and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force-- or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the 'Young Turks'. They seek to restore the consitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy-- to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC98640;The Ottoman monarchy has been overthrown, and now $COUNTRY$ stands in its place.

EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbours, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;
EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;

EVTOPTA100;What's wrong with a few drinks? *hiccup*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1000;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10000;We will be freemen, as our fathers were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA100000;History will not look kindly upon this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA100001;A great step forward for South Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA10001;We can expect increased liberal activity in the coming years;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA100040120;A tragedy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA100050120;A tragedy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA100080021;I'm sure he'll be perfect for the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA100080124;He will be sorely missed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA100080125;Truly, he loved his people too much. Literally, in this case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA1001;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA100100;Indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA1002;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1003;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10050;We pray for the fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10100;Let them eat cake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10105;Suppress them in parliament and hope that the countryside stays calm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10110;Bloody revolutionaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10120;I hope I'm not in the obituaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10130;Oh great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10140;...maybe that is what they want us to think?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10150;Send in the troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10160;Time to crack down on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10170;We shall consider it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10180;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10190;He sounds like a reasonable man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10200;Send in the troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10210;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10220;Good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10230;Quarantine the province;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10240;He was out drinking last night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10250;Say nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10260;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10270;They must be allowed to express their opinions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10280;Honestly, have you nothing better to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10290;Make sure it stays a local hit at best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10300;Perhaps some slight adjustments locally could be considered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10320;Obviously we must take pride in this publication!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA10330;Let them hold their little rally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA110;Cheers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1100;Gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1105;Diamonds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1107;That could come in handy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1109;Oil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA11100;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA11101;Long live the $UNION_ADJ$ people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA101928;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA11102;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA11103;Long live Il Risorgimento!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTA1140;Mixed blessings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA120;These saloons are becoming a problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1200;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12000;Blame local management;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1201;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12010;Rush through reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1202;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1203;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12030;Cover their losses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1204;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12040;Crops do not grow themselves, sadly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1205;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12050;Accept the loss;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1206;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12060;Stockpile the food;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1207;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12070;... how long *could* it last?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1208;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12080;The government will cover all losses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1209;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12090;There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1210;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12100;Only this province is affected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1211;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12110;Rock me in my cradle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1212;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12120;Dig deep and greedily!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1213;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12130;Work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1214;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12140;Let us celebrate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1215;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12150;Reimburse the widows with pensions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA1216;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12160;Social Responsibility!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTOPTA1217;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12170;They shall not have dyed in vain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12180;The government accepts no responsibility;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12190;Buy the fuel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12200;The interests of industry will prevail;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12210;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12220;Stockpile the extra tea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12230;We have none to spare;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12240;... what's it worth to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12250;Prioritize saving the rich neighborhoods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12260;Our offices must be representative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12270;We can still wear them, though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA12280;Discard the rags;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA130;Close down the bars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13000;Goodbye, $CONTINENTNAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13010;They are welcome to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13015;Our options are limited, and force of arms must be considered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13020;Allow them to return home;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13030;Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13040;Keep it small. Keep it simple. Keep it under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13050;It is not our place to intervene;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13055;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTOPTA13060;It is not our place to intervene;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13065;That's the spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13070;Why, that is excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13080;The foreigner is ignorant, not malevolent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13090;Our research will blossom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13100;Oh darn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13110;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13120;Enjoy the conversations, but ultimately do nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13130;Certainly! Our troops need to modernize;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13140;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13150;Ignore them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13160;Hand him over to the foreigners;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13170;Dispatch a punitive expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13180;We are pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13190;Reform the military;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13200;We bide our time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13201;By Jingo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13210;Push for reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13220;They'd better appreciate this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13230;Grudgingly erect a monument to the diplomat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13240;Turn the ship away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13250;Free Trade is Fair Trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13260;Bending with the wind is also a form of resistance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13270;Huzzah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13280;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13290;Major reform!;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13300;Open a bombard with whatever is available;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13305;A matter that merits national attention, I'm sure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13310;False teachings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13320;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13330;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13340;I see pillars of smoke...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13350;But it was very kind of him to offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13352;Indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13355;We weep for our loss;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13356;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13357;Noooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13358;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13360;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13400;Let's have a seat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13410;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA13420;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140;Order the saloon closed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140001;He can't preach from the grave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14010;Decisive arguments for Laissez Faire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140101;Force him into early retirement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14020;There are no Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140201;There is no need for a second trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14030;Give them residency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140301;We cannot allow this to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14040;We are patriots and we are going to fight for our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140401;The government has no role to play here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14050;Raise the tariffs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140501;His private affairs are none of our business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14060;Free trade ensures our long term competitive edge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140601;His next shift will be his last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14070;I see no reason to monopolize it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140701;If the church will not provide justice, the state gallows will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14080;Nonsense. The production quota will remain the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140801;Corpses make excellent foundations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14090;Naturally, they are right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA140901;Smash the reliefs into little bits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14100;That's rubbish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA141001;Let the bigotry flow high and wide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14110;Religion is a private matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA141101;These people are humans and they deserve rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14120;Secularization first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA141201;Framing an arson attack on minorities? Brilliant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14130;Try to keep an open mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA141301;Launch the counter-campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14140;Of course the church must be renovated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA141401;Launch the counter campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA14150;They have no right to demand anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA141501;Reject this ide. Our workers do not benefit from price dumping and external competition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA141503;Seek the presidency;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA141550;This is not the way to prosperity. Do not propose a free trade area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA14160;Limited citizenship until a proven and loyal subject;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA141601;Accept the nomination;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA14170;We must constantly strive to extend freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14180;To war, by Jingo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14190;The soldiers need better food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14200;That sounds expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14210;Peace always prevails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14500;Divert more water to local farms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14510;We should open the colony up to free competition between any and all traders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14520;Naturally, a new factory can only be a good thing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14530;We must seek an effective, honest and diligent administration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14540;The idea is certainly interesting, but it might be expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTOPTA14550;A rousing cheer for the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14560;We need to enact a more comprehensive education policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14570;We make no concessions to threats and violence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14580;Who gives a hoot about their religion anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14590;Lazy natives need to learn to adapt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14600;We must remain calm. This situation will pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14610;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14620;Intervene immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14630;Leave it be. Hopefully the situation will resolve itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14640;This is something, therefore it must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14650;Let us leave the lion sleeping in its jungle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14660;This will reflect beautifully on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14670;$COUNTRY$ apologizes for nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14680;I support the idea wholeheartedly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14690;My loyal subjects, you serve your country best at home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14700;It's a Bananza!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14710;Get out of my hair you profiteering scumbags;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14720;The colonies are of vital importance to the nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14730;Denounce the League;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14740;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14750;Conservative arguments prevail;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14760;The government must accept responsibility for its own shortcomings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14770;...and may the memory live long;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14780;... who cares!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14790;Fantastic news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14800;Just display the baubles somewhere locally;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA14810;If the shop needs to operate at those hours, who are we to have opinions about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA150;An expedient moment for temperance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA15600;We need to ensure adequate liquidity. Print money instead of taxing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA15601;Stop Printing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA15602;Face the hardships!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA160;The locals are free to do as they see fit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16000;Three rousing cheers for the Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA160001;Crush them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16001;We can expect this issue to linger for some time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16010;His soul is, indeed, marching on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16020;Worrying news;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16030;To our knights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16040;Of master...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16050;Something for everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA160502;A show of force should deal with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16060;Something for everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16070;All men were created equal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16080;Let them sing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16090;Leave them be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16100;Leave them be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16110;...so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16120;Nay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16130;The law is the law;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16140;Leave it be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16150;We have more important concerns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16160;Indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16170;My Stamp Collectors act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16180;Let them settle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16190;Grim news;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16200;A black day;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16210;A black day for $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16220;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16230;Grim news;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16240;Grim news;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16250;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16300;So this is the little lady...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16310;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16400;Trust the common man to get it right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16410;Rejoice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16415;They took my baby away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16420;Let us hope that this is their last stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16430;R.I.P.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16440;They will submit, sooner or later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16450;Hail to the Chief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA170;Let them work undisturbed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17000;There will be no suffrage at this junction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17010;Use the secret police to contain these dangerous revolutionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17020;This blatant discrimination is silly to the point of the absurd;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17030;Naturally the war-effort demands every available hand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17040;The legal status of women in the work place obviously needs to be regulated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17050;We watch, observe, learn, and, ultimately, do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17060;Oh, well, freedom of speech and all that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17070;A good time to push for a more conservative agenda;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17080;... and the stock-market report?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17090;I'm not sure how the locals will feel about all this littering. Not sure at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17100;Throw that willy-nilly out of my institution of higher learning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17110;Commend the book;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17120;I predict that the reform agenda will gain a fair amount of traction in the Upper House;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17130;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17140;I suggest that the local authorities force feed that hysterical woman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17150;Use the pressure of the central government to end the legislation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17160;Let us bask in the glow of this little gem of international renown that just fell into our lap;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17170;I might know of a little place that could decidedly get calmer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17500;We will not turn the arms of our soldiers against the citizens they exist to defend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17510;We will not recommend our citizens to form protection rackets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17520;You mean you fired someone? Nothing wrong with that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17530;Let us hope that this will be the end of this revolutionary prattle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17540;Time is on our side. Let us wait them out with vague promises, but little or no action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17550;I shall suggest down at the club that they start a subscription. Gin, anyone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17560;Commemorating bomb-throwers and murderers, in one of *my* states?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17570;And they say there is no leftist bias in the media... pfft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17580;An excellent initiative that can only be applauded!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17590;Yes? We have trade, wars, production, and you tell me about organized labour?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17600;An interesting development that we will make sure to keep an eye on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17610;Clamp down on the organization and attempt to shut it down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17620;The party's work is not illegal, and is therefore not a government concern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17630;Send out the military to restore order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17640;Let them prance about if they absolutely must;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17650;I believe we will see it primarily read by the lower class;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17660;Declare Martial law and send in troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17670;Denounce the campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17680;Allow them to prance about if they absolutely have to;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17690;Clowns in costumes are a local police matter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17700;Declare the union illegal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA17710;Crack down on this menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;

EVTOPTA22040;We need to consider more humane forms of punishment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA22050;Search High!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTA22070;The issue deserves due consideration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTA22500;Regulate! Tax! Ban! Panic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA22510;It's only a temporary crisis, no one can be blamed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTA22580;We must protect our workers at any cost, and this cornered market must be opened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA2260610;Families with traditional values raise large families;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA2500;Regardless of their actions, this can be used as a justification for war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA2510;We cannot allow this treacherous act of barbarism to go unpunished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA2520;Inform them of the potential consequences of continued non-cooperation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA2530;An invasion through there, and then deploy the troops so and so... interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA2540;Intolerable! Forceful action must certainly be considered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA2550;This must be given serious consideration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA2560;Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA2570;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTA30005;A grand display of the power and wealth of our empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3001;Fold completely and revoke the reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3002;Lots of rural charm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTA3100;Stop publishing this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3101;This scandalous slander ends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTA31101;We welcome the German investment.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31102;We have been ultimately driven from Europe...;;;;;;;;;;;x ;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31300;Good to know!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31301;That was close;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31302;A new age of communications in Switzerland;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31303;The vox populi has spoken.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31306;Order must be restored in Ticino.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31307;This could become an example for others. Or the state?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31308;Controversial ideas spreading.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31310;An idea long overdue;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31311;Naturally we shall sign this humanitarian document of progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA31501;It doesn't taste, anyways!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31502;Long live the Emperor! ;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31503;Let them speak Hungarian, if it makes them feel better.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31504;The Slavs free? Ridiculous;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA31505;Vivat!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA3203;Just because you're paranoid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3204;The conservatives won, fair and square;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA32500;A tragic death;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32501;So? Poland shall be kept off the map.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32502;Serves him right!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32503;To the glory of the Czar!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32504;Ah, sweet music!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32505;Sometimes two plus two must equal five.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32506;You can't stop the progress!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32507;We'll trade with Japan!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32508;A fantastic production!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32509;We have more bad climate than we need anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA32510;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA32511;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3300;Force through reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA33000;Amazing!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33001;Lions, zebras and elephants for everyone!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33002;Finally, the language will now be unified, too.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33004;We must make Schleswig German!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33005;We will fund it!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA3301;Argue for a pension raise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3302;I agree that certain revisions are in order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3303;...and?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3304;Get rid of the cruft;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3305;I concur with the good Sirs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3306;Promise Post-War Pensions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3307;A limited reform is what we can do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA33300;A tragedy!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33400;Marvellous!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33401;Scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33402;Art for everyone!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33403;An artistic genius;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33800;Tragic!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33801;A tragedy!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33802;Ahoy!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33900;We are now part of Hanover;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA33901;The lands of Hanover reunited;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA3400;...and?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3401;On the contrary, we need to lower subsidies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3402;Ignore the Taxpayer's Committee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3403;What do they want? Unemployment subsidies? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3404;Allow the union boss to mediate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA34100;They shall sing, not debate!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA34500;God save the Grand Duke!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA34600;Interesting ideas, nevertheless!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA34601;A Dreamer!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA34606;I don't know, I like the play better.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA34607;Use this throughout the country!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA34608;Those poor children!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA3502;He stays;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3503;Break up the strike;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA35300;Encore, Encore!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA35301;Encore, Encore!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA35400;A true masterpiece!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA35700;Labor merits value as much as wealth.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA3600;It was probably his own fault;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3601;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3602;Let them have their little fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3603;Why does this concern me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3604;We could use some better... channels of information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3605;Who do they think they are?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3606;But that's not free, now is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA3607;We have been blessed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA36200;Long live the King!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA36204;Free the slaves;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36205;Strengthen the defenses of Copenhagen.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA36207;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36208;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA49501;A royal marriage cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA49502;Oh well, I guess that's over then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA49503;A customs union cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA49504;It seems like a logical argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;

EVTOPTA800056;They're not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA800147;We have no choice but to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA800148;We never liked $FROMCOUNTRY$ anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA800149;We have no choice but to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA800152;That is a relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA80200;A bad way to start an election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA810056;The working class is triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA810057;A new future for $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;

EVTOPTA90009;Good call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA90040;This could mean trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA90100;Perhaps we can work something out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA90101;How depressing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA90103;I hate crowds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA90105;Better dead than red!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA90900;We are united again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTA97562;We have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA97565;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA97566;They must stand on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA97567;Whew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA97570;They are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, not 'foreigners'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA97700;We welcome their return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA98300 We must maintain stability even in a time of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;
EVTOPTA98301;We must face the future together!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTOPTA98301 This is unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;
EVTOPTA98305;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA98311;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have spoken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;

EVTOPTA999000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999001;Decisive arguments for Laissez Faire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999002;There are no Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999003;Give them residency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999004;We are patriots and we are going to fight for our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999010;Support the Conservative parties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999020;There shall be peace and quite in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999021;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;

EVTOPTA999031;We will have an eye on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999032;We will have an eye on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999040;They are right - support their reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999041;Sounds like a good idea, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA999042;Better late then never.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999043;A rightful initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999044;This has to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999045;You are right, we have to do something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA999046;I guess some privacy would be in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999049;The liberals are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999050;Progressivism is our only hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTA999055;We need less controls over families, not more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA999056;They should be grateful for what they have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA999057;There will be no reforms to immigration laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA999060;We've no reason to get involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTA999061;We will encourage the jingoists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTB100;An excellent initiative!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB10100;Spare no effort in relieving the local farmers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB10105;Let them have their say in parliament, and the effects might dissipate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB10110;The old order must be defended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTB10250;Accuse them of opportunism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB10270;Couldn't the principal do something about this nonsense?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB10280;It is good to see the classics receiving some attention. Socratic Dialogues, anyone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB10290;Such a voice must be heard in all of $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB10300;I refuse to submit to political demands by the entrenched elites;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB10320;Certainly, this is only propaganda designed to exploit the working classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB10330;Let the boys in blue have their way with these fermenters of revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB110;Pressure the local government to stop it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB11100;I will not accept a crown from the gutter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB11101;We will not have our ancestral rights infringed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB101928;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB11103;Who is this man, and what does he want from me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12000;The labourers are careless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12010;Oppose reform on grounds of principle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12030;Suggest they work overtime;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12040;We should consider some local restrictions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTB12060;Relieve civilian sufferings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12070;Distribute the food among the poor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12080;Sadly, there is little to be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12090;Reimburse locals for their losses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12100;Better living through chemistry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12110;Send some to our neighbors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12120;Some things should be forgotten;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTB12140;Establish a Naval School;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12150;Work overtime to replace the boilers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12160;Profit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12170;We shall all dye sooner or later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12180;Naturally the government will seek to aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12190;Turn down the offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12200;Our workers must be kept safe and sound;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTB12240;Sadly we cannot make any guarantees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12250;We make no distinctions of class.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12260;No wasteful fiscal policies on my watch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12270;Insist that government officials wear them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB12280;Give them to the poor and replace them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB130;We can not act at this time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13000;Expel the barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13010;Go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13015;We must respect and tolerate the differences between our respective cultures;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13020;Force them to stay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13030;Shut it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13040;Hmm. No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13050;Issue an edict banning the sale of opium;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13060;Order local officials to destroy opium shipments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13065;No! Apologize and stop this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13080;Perhaps some gold could make things better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13110;Is that a draft? Close the door!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13120;Dangerous or not, I believe she is right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13130;I think we can manage without it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13150;Round up the usual suspects;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13160;Execute him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13170;Drink the bitter chalice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13190;We will not abandon our traditional ways;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13200;Liberty or Death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13201;Perhaps we should let the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ follow there own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13210;The old ways endure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13220;Why? They have nothing to offer us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13230;Apologize, but leave it at that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13240;Let it through;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13250;We have more important matters to attend to;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13260;You do your worst, and we shall do our best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13290;Minor reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13300;Ignore it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB13358;Bah, more useless territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140;People should be free to drink;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14000;Some protective measures are in order to safe-guard our industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140001;Perhaps violence is not the answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTB14010;Decisive arguments for Interventionism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140101;If there's one thing we need more of it is surely more guns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTB14020;Religion is not a political issue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140201;Justice demands a re-trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTB14030;We need to limit their citizenship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140301;Only the strongest shall survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTB14040;We need to maintain constant vigilance in foreign affairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140401;Subsidize the mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTB14050;Lower the tariffs on those goods and raise it on some others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140501;Contact a newspaper immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTB14060;Essentially, free trade is to be preferred;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140601;Their opinions matter not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTB14070;You both have great arguments, but we will not monopolize that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140701;This is a great evil, but the faithful must not fall into unholy disbelief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14080;You have nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB140801;We will respect their ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;

EVTOPTB141201;Let the debate take its course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;

EVTOPTB141301;Our nation, our markets, and our goods indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;
EVTOPTB14140;Some funds could be considered on grounds of cultural importance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB141401;Free trade is the path to prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;
EVTOPTB14150;Why should they have the same rights?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB141501;Free trade and community is the way to prosperity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB141503;Do not get involved;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB141550;Propose a European Free Trade Area;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB14160;Limited citizenship, but with certain exceptions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14170;Full citizenship, with only minor qualifications, is the way forward;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14180;We do need a strong military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14190;They need better food in order to fight well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14200;Can't they fight without them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14210;Violence is never the answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14500;The rain will fall, sooner or later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14510;A liberal upper house ensures free trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14520;Brutally force people off their land? Not a very $COUNTRY_ADJ$ thing to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14530;Very concerning... but oh, my, it's almost teatime. Cricket later, anyone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14540;Let us see these creatures in their natural habitat instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14550;Long live the captains of industry and technology!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14560;I believe the resources could be better spent elsewhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14570;We must seek to negotiate an equitable settlement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14580;Their beliefs must be respected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14590;We must shoulder the responsibility;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14600;We shall make whatever concessions necessary to preserve the calm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14620;Intervene... eventually...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14630;Reincorporate the colony and take steps to prevent this in the future;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB14640;What? Me worry?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14650;Hunting is just a part of the circle of life;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14660;Let us invite that ambassador... what was his name?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTOPTB14670;We accept full responsibility for the wrongs committed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14680;I believe we must focus on the homefront first;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14690;A fantastic idea that we should spare no effort in implementing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14710;The customer is always rig... I mean... the government shall duly consider this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14720;We must undertake a national campaign in favor of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14730;Ignore the League;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14750;Liberal arguments prevail;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14760;The office is in the pocket of Big Industry, and Big Industry is to blame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14780;Naturally we must aid the colony, and help strive for its betterment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14790;Cover up the report, lest the capitalists get uppity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14800;This will teach future generations about the common heritage of mankind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB14810;I suppose we could drop by the Chamber of Commerce and have a chat with the boys...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB150;The temperance movement should bide its time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB15600;The world is soaked with bad credit. Do not print money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB160001;Out with the Manchu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTB16060;Plebian songs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPTB16100;Suppress the society;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB16110;Repulsive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB16120;Aye!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB16130;He stays in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB16140;Shut it down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB16150;Debate them at every opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB16180;Enact an ordinance to stop them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB16190;Enact an ordinance to stop them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB16400;Now is not the time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB170;Progressives must be opposed at every turn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17000;If only there were popular support for this idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17010;Applaud the Parliament, and express support for its cause;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17020;This blatant allowing of women to talk in public assemblies is silly to the point of the absurd;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17030;BLOOD AND CONQUEST!!! ... Apologies, what were you saying?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTOPTB17040;This man clearly has no future in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17050;We must express our cordial understanding of, and support for, these sentiments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17060;Maybe if they listened more to what these nice ladies are trying to explain to them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17070;Aaaah, the reactionary cause breathes morning air;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17080;This campaign for basic human rights needs to go national;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17090;Isn't there at least one MP living thereabouts?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17100;So our erudites are intimidated by the female intellect?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17110;Denounce the book;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17120;I predict that the cause will gain a fair amount of traction among the populace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17140;Release her and let us be done with this affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17150;Ignore the matter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17160;Let us hush up this blot of shame on our national pride, before someone catches wind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17170;At least we're better than the people over in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17500;I suppose we have a few units that we could spare for the good cause...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17510;Anything to stave off the red hydra!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17520;Denounce the profiteering of those fat-cats;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB17530;But.. the plight of the workers? Exploitation by the ruling classes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17540;Curtail local press distribution for any papers suspected of collaboration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17550;What is this... horrid piece of paper... a Fish & Chips wrapping?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17560;Naturally we support this fine display of international solidarity between workers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17570;Interesting, I am sure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17580;They must stop infringing on organizational freedoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17590;Hey! That's unconstitutional!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17600;Let us see if we cannot defuse some of this enthusiasm into more palatable forms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17610;Leave them be, and hope that they don't gain too much ground;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17620;This is just a ruse to build support for the party, end this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17630;Neat black flags they have! I have a white one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17640;Prevent the organization from recruiting on barracks grounds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17650;I believe we will see it primarily read by the middle class;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17660;Issue a national apology to the liberal party for the state's failure in protecting them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17670;Express tacit support for the campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17680;Outlaw paramilitary organizations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17690;Send in military troops to squash the rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17700;Leave them be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB17710;Let them talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTB17715;Keep the problem localized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTB17720;This must not come to violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTB17730;Let them demonstrate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;
EVTOPTB180;Stop the shipment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18000;Exert political pressure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18010;Conservative-Liberal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18020;It might be the time for reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18030;Ignore it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18040;Yes, they need to be contained;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18050;Motion dismissed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB1806;My feelings precisely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18070;Question the legality of the motion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18080;Reign them in;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18090;Filibuster any motion for reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18100;Force through the reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18110;Now is not the time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18120;Crack goes the whip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18130;Move to stop the defections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18140;Prevent the power grab;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18150;Let them do as they please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18160;We have done nothing wrong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18170;Unruly miscreant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18180;Brilliant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18190;We have enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18200;Ignore him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18500;Use the propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18510;Unmatched Glory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18520;We are in it to win it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18530;Other nations sing our praise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18540;Modesty and Restraint;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18550;Liberty shall not perish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18560;Let us forgive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18570;Further the cause of science;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB18580;It might be a while longer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB190;Drinking is, by definition, irresponsible;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19005;Fall back;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19010;Our isolation is splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19020;We have better things to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19022;The province belongs to $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19023;The cause of science demands it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19024;The governments policy stands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19025;Let's see if they can find any edible plants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19030;We have other concerns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19031;Nevermind, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19040;The Valley is Ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19043;Pressure the government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19330;I think it would be best if nothing came of this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19335;I do not feel that such an unimportant affair merits our attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB19345;We have come as bringers of civilization, not as looters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2000;An excellent opportunity to promote local harmony!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB20000;This doesn't concern us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB20001;Find those responsible and shut down this tripe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;;
EVTOPTB20002;Send in the troops!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;;
EVTOPTB20003;Yes! Increase efforts to track them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;;
EVTOPTB2010;Encourage local business to employ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB20100;Maybe we should talk about this...;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB20101;Concede their point.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB20102;Don't listen to him!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB20103;Fire the fool!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB20104;We are open to discussion.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB20105;Let's not fight over this.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2020;A clear sign that immigration must be curtailed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2030;I will keep Aniya Yezierska';;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2040;No need to hurry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2050;Bloody nonsense this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2060;Let us listen to their grievances;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2080;We shall certainly investigate the situation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2090;Seems that the locals have the right ideas there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB21010;Sorry, I gave at the office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB21020;Quarantine the affected state;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB21030;Not really, why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB21040;Weak and unable to resist, you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2110;... why do people tell me these things?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2120;Which is precisely what will happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2130;Pizza!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22000;This all sounds rather dreary...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22010;I think there are more humane solutions to consider;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22020;Certain reforms are arguably in order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22030;Let us not throw allegations wildly about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22040;Excellent! Next order of business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22050;Search Low!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22060;I say we stick with the old ways;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22070;I am not convinced. People need to learn lessons in life;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22080;I do not have time for the foppish drivel of bleeding-heart liberals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22500;Balanced government budget, deregulation and sound money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22520;As long as they are happy, I have no objections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22530;I think that the government that governs the least governs the best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22550;We must not let the whims of profiteers dictate the national economic policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22560;We should leverage this affluence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22570;We will not spend government money in support of a private company;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB22580;The freedom of trade shall not be abridged in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB23200;We must consider this proposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB23201;That's enough of this nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB23212;Keep looking at the sky!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB23300;This sounds like something out of a children's book, and I will have none of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB23301;This sounds like something out of a children's book, and I will have none of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB23400;The idea is interesting, but not at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB23401;No, we have better uses of our nation's limited resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB23403;We unfortunately can not attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2510;The explosion was an accident, and we cannot allow the mob to dictate foreign policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2520;Send an official letter thanking them for their time, and end the negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2530;I do not believe that this is really worth going to war over, truth to be told;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB2660;We will keep everything we've gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB3000;Seek local support for reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB30000;Our resources would be better used for other purposes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3001;Seek acceptable compromises;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3003;Back local Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3004;This situation is completely unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3005;Ignore the report to please conservatives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3006;Force it through;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3100;...it's just the truth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3101;I guess we caught him with his pants down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3102;Deny the rumors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB31311;We do not, at this time, feel inclined to sign this document;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3200;Let it operate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3201;Make him disappear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3202;Let's be sportsmanlike;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3203;THEY'RE AFTER ME!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3204;The liberals won, fair and square;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB32509;No, I don't think so. Maybe we could build a bridge there someday?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3300;Seek local support for reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB33004;The Danes of Schleswig are not a threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB33005;It is not our problem.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB3301;Argue against a pension raise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3302;I believe we must bide our time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3303;I guess we could use some reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3304;We are in no hurry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3305;I concur with the honorable gentlemen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3306;No promises at this junction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3307;We have an ambitious reform in mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3400;They're called poor people for a reason;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3401;The present unemployment subsidies work well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3402;Reduce the unemployment benefits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3403;What do they want? Better wages? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3404;Ignore them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB34607;It's immoral!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB3500;Leave him be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3501;Get back to work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3502;He goes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3503;Let them strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3600;They clearly need safety instructions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3601;Good for him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3602;So?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3603;I agree with the employers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3604;Violate their personal integrities? Doubtful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3605;I find the demands reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3606;Our workers' health is our first priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB3607;We are an international example;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB36202;Let them be;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB36203;Let him be;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB36204;Crush the rebellion;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

By taking it, along with the extra name Ditunga ("homeland"), Kalonji was able to closely tie himself and the South Kasaian state to the Luba Empire to increase its legitimacy in the eyes of the Baluba. In order to avoid accusations of impropriety, the title was bestowed on Kalonji's father on 12 April 1961, who then immediately abdicated in favour of his son.

The bloodiest years of the conflict were during the 1992?001 period and resulted in over a thousand battle related deaths.On December 30, 2004 an agreement was reached between the MFDC and the government which promised to provide the voluntary integration of MFDC fighters into the country's paramilitary forces, economic recovery programmes for Casamance, de-mining and aid to returning refugees.Nevertheless, some hard-line factions of the MFDC soon defected from elements of the MFDC who had signed the agreement and no negotiations took place following the breakdown of talks in Foundiougne on 2 February 2005.Fighting again emerged in 2010 and 2011 but waned following the April 2012 election of Macky Sall.
